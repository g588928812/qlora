### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did Donald Trump win?
### Human: Well, it's a great question. And I have some thoughts about why, but I think that this is one of those situations where you can look at any number of factors and you can get a satisfying answer depending upon what your predisposition is. You know, if you are somebody who thinks that the problem was that Democrats ran terrible candidates in the midterms and that we needed better candidates, then there were all sorts of things that happened that could have played into that. If you believe that the country was ready for a change after eight years of Barack Obama, and the Democratic Party was just too attached to its own identity rather than looking outward, then there were all kinds of reasons to be dissatisfied with the status quo.
### Assistant: So you don't see, though, how someone like Donald Trump could appeal to voters who had voted Democrat in previous elections? Like they were not voting Republican before?
### Human: Yes. Look, I think that the key to understanding why Donald Trump was elected in part is that we live in a deeply divided society. There are lots of different ways to measure that. Some people use economic data; others look at voting patterns or even demographic shifts. The point is that there’s no way around it; there’s a divide between rural and urban America. There’s a divide within cities themselves. There’s also a racial dimension to these divides. But the reality is that in America, more and more people are living in communities where they interact only with other Americans who share their background and outlook. That includes the suburbs, which increasingly consist of white voters who may have gone back and forth between parties over time, but now feel politically homeless because neither party really speaks to them. Then you’ve got large swaths of the heartland, especially in rural areas, that are becoming ever more conservative in their views, while still feeling economically left behind by globalization and automation.
So when I think about why Trump won in 2016, I tend to come down on the side of demographics and geography. He won among white working class voters who felt abandoned by both political parties and who were drawn to him because he promised to shake up Washington. Those same folks voted for Barack Obama twice. They turned out in droves in 2008 and 2012, but they stayed home in 2016
### Assistant: Yeah, so there's something about the geography of America that's changing dramatically. What do you make of that? Because again, I grew up in Indiana and Wisconsin. It feels like everywhere I go nowadays is populated by either liberals or conservatives. Wherever I go, there's either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground anymore.
### Human: Well, it depends on what you mean by “middle ground.” If you mean that everyone agrees about everything and nobody disagrees about anything except maybe on trade policy, I would say that's probably not true. But if you mean that there's room for disagreement without it degenerating into shouting matches or name calling, then I do agree with you. People aren’t listening to each other. We don’t talk about our values. Instead, we try to find ways to demonize each other. We take every difference in opinion and try to turn it into an existential threat.
### Assistant: Do you think that's something that's changed over time, or is it something new?
### Human: I do think it's changed. When I was growing up, most families didn't sit down together and watch Fox News or MSNBC or CNN during dinner. Today, that's become the norm for many households. Partly because cable TV has gotten cheaper and partly because smartphones allow us to tune in wherever we want whenever we want. As a result, many Americans now spend more time watching partisan news outlets than talking to their neighbors. In fact, according to Gallup, only about half of Americans claim to know someone they disagree with politically whom they consider a friend. And this matters because we used to have shared values, norms and institutions that helped to moderate our differences. That's why I call it the decline of the common life. Nowadays, we mostly communicate with people whose values are already aligned with ours. And when we finally do talk to those who disagree with us, we assume that they must be motivated solely by self interest rather than principle.
As a consequence, Americans often seem unable to listen to each other, let alone learn from one another. And if you can't learn from people with whom you disagree, then you can never hope to persuade them of anything. And that's why it seems like we're stuck in perpetual gridlock in Washington DC today.
When I was young, I thought that the future belonged to people who could listen to others. After all, isn't that how we solve problems? By coming together,
### Assistant: I mean, that's the idealized version of listening. That's the American ideal of democracy.
### Human: Right. We believed that if we learned to hear one another, we might learn to understand one another. And then once we understood one another, we could act collectively to improve our lot. But lately, we seem to be going in the opposite direction. Many of us have grown suspicious of one another because we assume that we don't share the same basic values. And even if we did agree on the big issues, we fear that the person across the table might somehow exploit whatever agreement we reach to further their own interests. So instead of learning from one another, we argue past one another until we lose patience altogether.
The irony is that we need one another more than ever before. Our economy is increasingly dominated by giant multinational corporations. Our schools are failing to prepare students for jobs that haven't yet been created. And the gap between rich and poor is widening faster than ever before. None of this would matter much if we were able to rely on government to provide solutions. Unfortunately, governments today are far less effective than they were fifty years ago. Thanks to budget cuts and outsourcing, state and local governments are often unable to keep pace with rising costs. Meanwhile, federal agencies face constant pressure from lobbyists eager to shape legislation in their favor. All of this makes governing harder than it should be. And it leaves us vulnerable to crises that require swift action from Washington DC.
This is precisely the kind of challenge that we need our leaders to tackle head-on. Yet
