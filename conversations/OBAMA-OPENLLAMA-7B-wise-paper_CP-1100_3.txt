### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump?
### Human: Well, I have no idea why, but it was not because of any magic that I cast. And that's one reason why I haven't really stayed involved. I mean, look, obviously, if I had won in 2008, I would be doing exactly what President Biden is doing now except instead of inheriting this mess, I would have started with a clean slate. So I don’t know how he did it other than he ran a very smart campaign, he raised more money than anybody else, he brought out African Americans and other people of color at higher rates than they ever had before, he brought out suburbanites, independents, women, and so forth. And then once he got into office, he governed well enough to make sure that his party didn't get wiped out in the midterms. But ultimately, this wasn't about me. It wasn't even about him. It was about something much bigger. Because the truth is that our democracy was under stress before COVID and before January 6. The polarization, the fact that we were seeing candidates running on platforms that seemed designed to appeal only to their base rather than trying to reach out across some sort of middle ground meant that it was hard to govern. Even when there was a Democratic president and a Democratically controlled Congress, sometimes it felt like we couldn't get anything done, which then contributed to a sense of frustration among those voters who felt ignored. Then
### Assistant: When you say “Democrat,” what does that mean?
### Human: What that means is somebody whose philosophy is one that is built around a set of values that includes things like civil rights, economic opportunity, environmental protection, upholding our values around the world.
### Assistant: So the basic principles underlying your political views are the same as the Democrats’.
### Human: Well, yes and no. There are certainly elements within the Democratic Party today that are more liberal than others and that want to see us do things differently. That doesn't necessarily jibe with everything that I believe. But broadly speaking, yeah, I mean, I am a Democrat.
Then comes the pandemic where everybody, both Republicans and Democrats, were suddenly confronted with these life and death issues and had to figure out how to deal with them. And again, whether they agreed with all aspects of every decision that was made or not, nobody could deny that everybody was just trying to do their best to keep people safe and to help families through what otherwise might have been a very dark time. And finally came January 6, which was just a culmination of everything that we had been dealing with over the last few years. In each case, people responded to that in different ways. Some people said, hey, this isn't working. We need new leadership. Others said, nope, this guy (gestures towards myself) hasn't been perfect, but he seems like a pretty decent human being. He cares about people. You may disagree with his decisions, but at least you can tell he's making decisions based on principle. And maybe you agree with his principles. Maybe you don't. But regardless of what you think of those principles, he seems sincere about them. And so we ought to give him another chance. So that's what happened.
### Assistant: How did you feel personally when Trump lost the election?
### Human: Honestly, I felt relief that after four years of living with this guy, I didn't have to worry about waking up to the news that some bomb had gone off somewhere or that he had decided to declare martial law or fire someone in his Cabinet that he didn't like or that he wanted to go back into the Oval Office somehow. Like, I knew he was crazy, but until he actually did something crazy, I thought that most of it was just talk. Once he actually did something crazy, that was when I realized, oh, he is capable of doing things that aren't just talk.
### Assistant: What do you think it takes to defeat a person like that in a second term? Do you think it’s possible?
### Human: I hope so, although it probably won't happen given how polarized our politics are right now. But hopefully somebody will run against whoever ends up being the Republican nominee in 2024 and win. If they do that, then that person will become president.
