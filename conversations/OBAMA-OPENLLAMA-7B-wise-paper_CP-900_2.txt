### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected?
### Human: Itâ€™s a great question because I actually believe that it wasn't inevitable that Donald Trump would be president. And if we had nominated someone who I believed could have won and did win four years later, then Hillary Clinton would probably be president today. So this was a close election, which means it hinged upon a small number of voters in three or four key swing states. And there are some pretty obvious reasons why somebody like Mr. Trump ended up winning those states. First off, when you look at how he campaigned during the general election, he went after traditional Republican constituencies, people who might normally vote for the party but felt alienated. They were angry about trade deals or worried about immigration or concerned about foreign policy issues. And they thought that maybe somebody like him would shake things up. And they saw in him a form of populism. And so they came out to support him. On the other hand, there were also large parts of the Democratic base, especially younger voters and minority voters, who didn't feel sufficiently engaged throughout the primary process. They weren't excited about either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. And then towards the end of the campaign, they stayed home rather than coming out to vote against somebody whom they perceived as a threat to their values and interests. And in the final analysis, what ended up happening was that while both candidates got roughly equal shares of the popular vote across the country, the difference turned out to be determined by these handful
### Assistant: of states. That's such an interesting point you make. There's such an important role that the candidate plays in the election outcome.
### Human: Absolutely. And I think it's fair to say that Mr. Trump may have benefited from the fact that he spent more time criticizing Mrs. Clinton than he did trying to outline positive messages about himself. I mean, let's face it, when you listen to the debates, she clearly understood what her message should be and what she needed to talk about. She focused on, you know, how she was qualified and prepared to take over the Oval Office. He, meanwhile, seemed to spend most of his time talking about all sorts of things that weren't really relevant to the job of running the country. And that meant that even though she had a significant lead going into Election Day, the people who showed up to vote for her weren't necessarily the ones who decided whether she ultimately became president or whether Mr. Trump did.
### Assistant: How much does each side underestimate the opponent during the primaries versus the actual election? In your opinion, how much is due to human error compared to structural factors?
### Human: Oh, I think it's definitely a mixture of both. You know, sometimes one person can just make critical mistakes. But usually campaigns are run within fairly tight parameters. The money that gets raised determines what ads get bought and where they air. The media focuses its attention on certain aspects of the race. And so you end up with a very narrow debate about relatively similar sets of issues and personalities. And once the field narrows down, whoever has more resources tends to benefit disproportionately from the way the system works. That doesn't mean they always end up doing better than everybody else, but it certainly gives them an advantage.
### Assistant: What about the structure itself? Like, is there something fundamentally wrong with the way elections work? Is it too expensive to run a successful campaign? Or is there something else that needs to be fixed?
### Human: Well, it costs a lot of money to run a presidential campaign now. Just to put things in perspective, the last couple of cycles cost somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion altogether. And that includes spending not only by the candidates themselves, but also by outside groups that come in to try and influence the race through television advertising or organizing grassroot volunteers or anything else. So yeah, it's definitely become more expensive. But I don't think anybody thinks that the current system is perfect. We need to find ways to reduce the amount of money that goes into our political process without sacrificing our basic rights to free speech and having access to information about how government makes decisions.
### Assistant: What about the role of social media? Obviously, Facebook played quite a big part in this election. Does that worry you, or do you see it as another tool for communication and connection amongst humans?
### Human: Well, obviously, social media can be a powerful force for good or evil depending on how it's used. I think there's no doubt that it helped mobilize supporters behind Mr. Trump during the Republican primaries and eventually helped him win the White House. But it also gave voice to millions of Americans who hadn't previously been heard in our national discourse. I mean, you know, I read this statistic recently that before the 2016 election, there were only five million Twitter accounts following @POTUS, which is the official account for the President of the United States. Afterwards, there were 38 million. So clearly, there's no telling exactly what impact social media will have on future elections, but it's safe to say that it will play an increasingly important role in determining who wins and who loses.
