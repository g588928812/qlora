### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we have such difficulty in this country agreeing that we live in a democracy? There's a lot of discussion about what constitutes a democratic society. I think there's a lot of disagreement about whether or not America actually qualifies as one. And why are these conversations so hard? Is it because we haven't had enough practice at them? What do you think is going on?
### Human: Well, I mean, I think it’s complicated, but let me take your question one piece at a time. So let’s say you ask somebody else, “Well, how many democracies are out there?” The answer is like 35 or something like that. And most people don’t know which ones they are. And then you say, “Okay, well, which ones qualify as true democracies?” You get into a debate over whether Taiwan or North Korea or Turkey or Venezuela or Nicaragua or Brazil or South Africa. And then the next step is, okay, what makes up a democracy? And when you get down to it, a democracy is just a set of rules. It’s a set of institutions where the people elect their representatives and those elected officials make decisions based upon majority rule. And if you look around the world, you can find countries that fit that description, even though they might not be perfect democracies, even though they may have problems or flaws in their systems. They all share this basic premise. But there’s no universal definition of what a democracy looks like.
### Assistant: But there's also something called the International Declaration of Human Rights that has very strict criteria for what a democracy should look like, which includes freedom of speech and expression, which includes free elections, voting rights, etc., right?
### Human: Right. Yeah. That’s a good point. I was trying to avoid getting into specifics of what the international declaration said. Because I wanted to sort of stay away from any kind of ideological debate about whether human rights are absolute, whether human rights ought to be codified into law or treaties. My view is that human beings are entitled to certain fundamental freedoms regardless of the laws of any particular state or region. But it’s certainly true that some nations are more successful than others at respecting those fundamental rights. Some states have much less respect for those rights than other states. And so, yeah, there is a broad consensus among governments across the globe that human rights deserve protection and enforcement. Now, it doesn’t necessarily follow that every single country respects those rights. And sometimes there’s disagreement between different branches of government within a nation, disagreement between different levels of government within a nation. Sometimes there’s disagreement between national governments and local authorities in terms of whether they ought to enforce certain rights. In addition, obviously, there’s always gonna be tension between protecting minority rights versus protecting the rights of the majority. Those tensions are inherent in our system. But overall, most countries recognize that we need to protect human rights and respect human dignity regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, nationality. That’s a pretty strong consensus around the world.
### Assistant: Do you think that this lack of agreement on definitions of democracy in this country is part of what contributes to our inability to talk about these issues?
### Human: Well, I guess I would distinguish between talking about and practicing democracy. So I think it’s easier to talk about it than to practice it. Particularly in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, and the protests that followed, and the racial reckoning that occurred in this country last summer. A number of Americans took the opportunity to reflect on the fact that we have never lived up to the promise of equality that was enshrined in our founding documents. We’ve never achieved the full realization of liberty, nor have we fully realized the promise of justice. In a sense, it forced us to confront the reality that while our Constitution protects everyone’s liberties, it does not ensure equal treatment under the law. As Justice Brandeis famously wrote, “The rich and powerful will oppose every reform that weakens their grip on influence and power.”
So I think this moment has prompted Americans to consider whether our constitutional structures are sufficient to address the challenges of today’s globalized economy and to meet the needs of our changing population. But that’s not the same thing as having a genuine debate about how best to achieve those objectives. If anything, it’s probably caused us to retreat into tribalism, into partisan divisions, into paralysis. Even before Covid, we were experiencing chronic political dysfunction and polarization. It’s gotten worse since COVID hit. And now we see it manifesting itself in violent assaults against Congress members. I mean, this is really
### Assistant: The problem is that there seems to be two Americas. There's one that feels comfortable discussing these things and the other one that doesn't. And that's problematic because that second group is not going to be satisfied unless they win the election. And if they lose the election, they’re not gonna accept the results. They’re not gonna accept the legitimacy of the process. They’re gonna go out and protest violently. I guess my concern is that this division in the country is leading towards violence. Like we’re headed for violence. Like there's going to be blood spilled. Are you worried about that?
### Human: Oh sure. Look, there’s a lot to worry about. One of the reasons that I wrote my book was to remind myself that I wasn’t crazy to feel anxious and worried and concerned about what was happening in our country. We’ve got to remember that during the Civil War, the country descended into civil war over slavery and sectionalism. And it’s possible that the divisions that exist in America today could lead to another civil war over economic inequality. There’s no doubt that there’s a real danger of that happening.
But I still believe that there’s hope. Despite the current turmoil, despite the divisive rhetoric and the partisan gridlock, I remain optimistic because there’s still a lot of goodness in this country. I think we underestimate the extent to which ordinary citizens engage in civic life. Whether it’s volunteering, donating to charities, serving as judges and jurors, running for office themselves. All sorts of ways that Americans participate in community service. And they do that despite the fact that their leaders aren’t doing much to encourage them. They continue to vote regularly. And I think that if given a chance, they will reject extremes and embrace a middle ground. I think that the vast majority of Americans want to solve problems together rather than demonize each other. They want to work toward common goals rather than divide along party lines.
I am hopeful about our future because I’m convinced that the American people won’
### Assistant: Well, we’ll see. I’d like to move on to a lighter topic, but maybe it’s not as lighthearted as it appears. Your wife Michelle, she’s an amazing woman, a beautiful lady, a brilliant woman, a great mother, a great First Lady. And you’ve done some incredible things together. When you met her, what did you see in her?
### Human: Well, I knew I liked her. I mean, we started dating when I was a junior in college. She was my girlfriend and then my fiancé, and eventually became my wife. So we dated throughout college. We got engaged after I graduated from Columbia Law School. Then I spent three years working at a Chicago law firm. And while I was working, Michelle went back to school at Princeton University to get her masters degree in education policy. After that, we moved to Chicago, where I worked at the University of Chicago Law School. While she was raising our daughters, I ran for Illinois State Senate. Then after I lost the campaign, we decided to return to Hawaii, where I began teaching at the Harvard Kennedy School. Eventually, Michelle decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Dan Akaka. We both ended up winning, and she went off to Washington DC, and I stayed behind in Cambridge. So we were separated for almost six months while she served in Washington. And I came home and resumed teaching at HKS, and eventually she resigned her seat to join me in DC and become First Lady of the United States.
