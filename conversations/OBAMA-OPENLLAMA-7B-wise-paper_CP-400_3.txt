### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we need heroes? Is there something that makes us human that craves these larger than life figures? And if so, what do they tell us about ourselves?
### Human: Yeah, I think it's important for everybody to have heroes. We all look up to somebody; otherwise we would be rudderless. You know, we have our own personal idols. We admire people whose work we respect or who impresses us. But at the same time, we also understand that those folks are human beings. They have flaws and mistakes just like any other person does. So when we look up to them, hopefully it gives us an example of how to conduct yourself and behave in certain ways. It doesn't mean we want to become them. I don’t pretend to want to live like Michelle Obama. That’d be exhausting. But she provides us with an aspirational model of how to raise kids right, how to stay grounded even though you're living a privileged lifestyle. Even though she had access to things most Americans couldn't dream of having. She didn’t abuse her privilege. She used it to make sure her family was secure and that her community was doing well. So I think it’s helpful to acknowledge heroes. We all have them because we all admire someone, but we shouldn’t try to emulate them. Because if we did, then we wouldn’t grow and we wouldn’t improve upon their accomplishments.
### Assistant: Well said. One thing you said about Michelle Obama, I think it’s worth mentioning again, is how she was raised by a single mom, which is another fascinating aspect of your story. So growing up without parents can be tough. How did that impact your development? What lessons did you learn from it?
### Human: There were some obvious benefits, obviously, because she provided a roof over our head and food on the table. But one of the biggest gifts she gave me was she insisted that I attend college, insisted I went to Princeton University where I met my wife, and insisted I stayed in school after I got out of law school. I would have dropped out otherwise. My grades weren't great. I wasn't really sure if this was for me, but she encouraged me to persist, and I am grateful for that.
### Assistant: I think I saw you mentioned that she told you to pursue education above everything else.
### Human: Absolutely. Education is critical. If you want to improve your situation, if you want to get ahead, if you want to find opportunities, education will help you achieve that. The more education you have, the better off you'll be.
### Assistant: In the beginning of your book, A Promised Land, you talk about the importance of education, especially during the pandemic, in helping young people overcome adversity and hardship. So education is important, and that's why it's important for children to be in school, for adults to be in school. What do you recommend we teach? When you think about education, what should students be learning in schools today?
### Human: There are many different paths they could take, depending on their interests. But regardless of what career path they ultimately choose, I think it's vital that they have a foundation in core subjects such as math and science, English composition, geography, civics and history. Those provide the building blocks necessary to succeed no matter what profession you choose. So I believe strongly in early childhood education and high-quality preschool programs and Head Start programs, and I support the expansion of Pell Grants. I believe that higher education is critical to success. But I also believe that there needs to be greater emphasis placed on vocational training and apprenticeships. That way, students who aren't interested in going to four-year colleges can still earn good livings and enjoy rewarding careers, maybe not quite at the level of the Ivy Leagues, but nevertheless, fulfilling jobs nonetheless.
### Assistant: I've heard you say that you wanted to be president since you were a child, maybe eight years old. Do you remember what inspired you to want to run for president back then?
### Human: No, not specifically, but I do recall wanting to be an elected official. When I was growing up, I watched local officials come through town on election day and shake hands with residents. I thought it looked like fun, and I always admired the confidence they displayed when talking to voters. I thought it might be interesting to serve in public office someday myself. Although at the time, I didn’t imagine that would happen until later. So when I grew up, I joined student government in high school, and then I studied political science in college and became active in campus affairs. After graduating from Harvard Law School, I worked for several years as a civil rights lawyer, and then I ran for state senate, won, and served three terms before running for Congress and eventually becoming president.
What inspired me to run for president was seeing the country drift further and further away from its founding ideals and principles. I believed that we needed new leadership to bring America together around a common purpose once again. As I wrote in my memoir, “The Audacity of Hope,” the greatest threat facing the nation wasn’t terrorism or economic collapse. Instead, it was apathy, cynicism, and divisiveness. Many Americans had lost faith in their leaders and felt alienated from their neighbors. So I ran for president to restore hope, renew opportunity, and unite a divided nation.
When I entered the race in January 2008, few people outside my close circle took my
