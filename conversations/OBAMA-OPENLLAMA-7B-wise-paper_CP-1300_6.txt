### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected president?
### Human: I guess we have to go back to what happened during the campaign and what it says about us as a country. And the fact that this was such a close election should say something about how well-positioned Hillary Clinton was to be our next president. She won the popular vote by millions more than Mr. Trump did. So the reason why she lost was not just because of Russian interference and other forms of meddling. It wasn't just because there were Comey letters at some point. There were a whole bunch of reasons. But if you look at her performance and where she was running relative to him, she had more experience, had been a Senator longer than he had been anything else, was secretary of state, and had run against Barack Obama twice before and still come out ahead. And so when you look at all those things put together, it's hard to believe that somebody who’d never held any political office would win over someone like that. What explains it then? I think there are probably multiple answers to that question. One is that despite the fact that she was clearly qualified and done good work for the public, and despite the fact that I know her personally and liked her very much and worked closely with her while I was president, there are certain constituencies that felt that maybe she represented a status quo that they didn't feel was working for them. And that dynamic was magnified after the Great Recession hit. You fast forward through what happened between
### Assistant: 2008 and 2016.
### Human: Yeah. After the great recession hit, people saw their homes values decline, lost jobs, couldn't get decent paying jobs even when they were working. So they looked around and said, “Who can fix this?” And they decided that maybe someone who could promise to make big changes but might not really have any idea how to actually implement those changes was going to resonate better than somebody who had already been working in government. and trying to solve problems for years. I mean, that obviously wasn't the only factor involved. If we look at the results of the election, there were also a lot of factors that went into the result. But it was a pretty decisive victory for Mr. Trump. He got 3 million more votes than Secretary Clinton. so there were obviously a number of things at play. And again, I don't want to pretend that anybody understands the psychology behind these sorts of voting patterns, especially since we now live in a media environment where people get their information in sound bites rather than having to process complicated arguments over long periods of time. But that's part of the problem today. We've become so atomized. People get their news from Facebook feeds or Twitter accounts. They don't necessarily have the benefit of having a robust discussion about issues. They may not have a sense of how an issue will affect somebody else whose life circumstances are different from theirs. And unfortunately, that means that instead of having thoughtful discussions and making decisions based on facts
### Assistant: which is exactly what the job of a president is supposed to do.
### Human: Exactly right. The role of the president is to try to bring people together and find common ground and make sure everybody's doing their part to address the challenges facing America and our planet. Unfortunately, that hasn't always been the case. I think another thing that contributed to the outcome was the fact that there was a lot of negative campaigning during this election cycle. Both candidates spent a lot of time talking about their opponent's shortcomings rather than focusing on what they themselves were proposing to do if they became president. And the truth is, nobody likes to watch a debate where both sides are attacking each other rather than making positive arguments for why their side makes more sense. And sadly, that seemed to be the approach taken by both campaigns.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask you about that, because you ran for office yourself. You ran for the senate in Illinois. You ran for the presidency. How much does your own personal story matter versus your ideas? Because I remember you saying that you thought you're a better speechwriter than you are a candidate. In the primaries and the caucuses, how important is your personality and how important is your image and all that kind of stuff?
### Human: For me, it was clear early on that the best way to communicate my vision for the future of this country was through speeches and one-on-one interactions with voters. I believed that telling people directly about my upbringing and what motivated me to get involved in public service and why I wanted to see America lead on the world stage was the most effective way to persuade people to support me. When it came time to debate my opponents and make appearances at rallies, I tried to stick to the substance of the issues rather than engaging in personal attacks. That's not to say that I avoided criticizing my rivals; I certainly did that when it was warranted. But overall, I tried to keep my message focused on what I believed was most important and how I would use the power of the presidency to move the country in a new direction.
### Assistant: Well, I remember your DNC acceptance speech was amazing. You gave many amazing speeches throughout your career, but that stands out as one of the great ones. I think it was the last one. You spoke about hope and change. Do you regret using those words hope and change?
### Human: No, I wouldn't say I regret using those words. Obviously, there's no magic formula for winning elections. Anybody who tells you differently isn't being honest with you. But I genuinely believed that the combination of my experience, my qualifications, and the vision for this country that I shared with the Democratic Party was the right message for the times. And ultimately, that's what helped me prevail in the end.
Now, whether or not I would use those same words in the same way today is a different question entirely. We are living in a very different moment in history than we were eight years ago. Our country is dealing with a lot of complex problems that require us to come together and find solutions that are grounded in reality rather than ideology. And while I still firmly believe that we need to pursue policies that create opportunity for everyone and ensure that every kid gets a fair shot regardless of their background, I recognize that we cannot simply rely on hope alone. We also need to take concrete steps to make progress towards these goals. And that's why I'm proud to have been involved in a lot of work during my time as president to help lift people out of poverty, reduce inequality, and combat discrimination. Even though none of those efforts were perfect, they laid the foundation for real progress in subsequent years.
For example, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended health coverage to millions of Americans who previously lacked it. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street
