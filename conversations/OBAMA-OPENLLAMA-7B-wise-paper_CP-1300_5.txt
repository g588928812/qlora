### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did America choose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton?
### Human: I think there were many reasons why we wound up with President Trump instead of Mrs. Clinton. It's not reducible to any one thing. But it was a combination of things. And obviously, this is going to be myopic because I wasn’t on the ground everywhere. I don’t know what people felt like in Erie, Pennsylvania versus Los Angeles. But let me just give some generalizations that I hope are helpful. One is she didn’t connect enough with working class voters who feel left out, ignored even, by both political parties. There’s a lot of bitterness and frustration on the part of those folks who feel like their skillsets aren’t valued anymore in this economy where everybody seems to have college degrees. And they’re told constantly, “You should go back to school.” If you can’t get a job after six months looking for work, “Go back to school,” if you can’t find housing that suits your needs, “Get a better education so you can afford it.” And meanwhile, these folks feel like they’ve got all kinds of responsibilities; they may have kids; they may have mortgages; they may have health care costs. They don’t see a whole lot of help from either party. So there’s a real sense of abandonment. Then add to that the fact that during the course of her campaign, there was a narrative about how Mrs. Clinton was the most
### Assistant: qualified candidate ever. Well, I mean, yeah, that was definitely part of it, but she also was notoriously untrustworthy. She was called a liar more than anybody else. That definitely had something to do with it. Yeah. And then there's just this fatigue with the establishment politicians.
### Human: Right. And this is not new. We saw it with Brexit in Britain and we saw it in various elections around Europe. You know, people are feeling like their leaders aren’t listening to them and they’re tired of having these same old faces on TV every night. And they want somebody who’s a fresh face. Now, in our case, it happened to be a 70 year old white guy who spent decades in public office. And maybe that was not exactly what people wanted, but it certainly wasn’t what people feared. I think what they really were looking for was somebody who they believed understood their situation and could relate to them. And when you look at the Trump candidacy, He played to that. He ran as sort of the outsider, someone who basically said, “I understand you guys. I'm going to tell it like it is.” “We need someone who's not beholden to special interests.” “I’ll cut deals with people who hate each other.” “The system is rigged.” “Politicians are crooked.” “Hillary's a criminal.” “She should be in jail.” Those themes resonated with people who were already predisposed to vote for him anyway, but it also opened up doors for him among those who might otherwise have voted for another Republican or stayed home. Because at least he seemed different. Even though ultimately he proved himself to be anything but different once he got into the
### Assistant: office. Once he became president, he governed as a standard Republican.
### Human: Exactly right. But again, that was part of the appeal early on.
### Assistant: Can you talk about the specific policy areas? What were the things that Hillary Clinton offered which people found unappealing? And specifically related to the last point you made, which is experience.
### Human: Well, let’s take experience. For whatever reason, a number of Americans simply believe that the longer you've been in Washington, the less likely you are to be able to make good decisions. And they say, “Look, Mr./Mrs. Smith is out there trying to raise their family, pay their bills. They don't know what goes on inside the beltway. Their judgment must be suspect. But someone who’s been there for 30 years, well, clearly they’re corrupt. They’ve sold themselves out. They only care about keeping their job.” Now, that may or may not be true, but it’s an easy argument to make against somebody like Hillary Clinton, who had been there for 30 plus years. On the other hand, she also had more foreign policy experience than anyone running for president since Richard Nixon. I mean, she literally spent a lifetime dealing with world leaders, starting way back when she was a young lawyer, working on children’s rights issues abroad. When she went to the Senate, she chaired the subcommittee on global women’s issues. As Secretary of State, she dealt with literally dozens of countries. So she had more experience than any other potential commander in chief except perhaps for my husband.
### Assistant: But nobody cared about that experience.
### Human: Nobody cared about that experience! Except for maybe a very small subset of voters. The vast majority of people weren’t interested.
