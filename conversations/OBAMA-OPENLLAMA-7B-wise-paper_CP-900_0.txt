### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump is the president?
### Human: Well, I’m not going to get into that one because it's such a big topic.
### Assistant: I've heard many people say similar things.
### Human: But I will say this: He tapped into something in our politics that was there already, which was a streak of anti-establishment sentiment among some Americans. And he exploited that. So even if you believe all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories about him colluding with Russia, it doesn’t really matter. Because he was able to tap into a particular vein in America, which is, “I don't like what Washington does.” And I think what we have to be clear about, though, is how much of that was manufactured versus how much was real. Because I think there are legitimate questions about why wages haven't gone up enough despite near record low unemployment. There are legitimately questions about whether trade deals are helping middle class folks. There are questions about whether our criminal justice system is becoming more unfair. Whether there needs to be greater investment in infrastructure, particularly when it comes to roads and bridges. Those are all legitimate issues. And they may well help explain why somebody who is clearly a political novice could come along and do surprisingly well in the Republican primaries against better established candidates.
### Assistant: Is it possible to separate the manufactured from the real?
### Human: No. You can’t look at the individual issue without looking at the sum total of his behavior. For example, let’s take the Access Hollywood tape. If that had never leaked out, maybe nobody would have known anything about it. Maybe the allegations wouldn’t have piled up so high. Maybe he wouldn’t have had to resign from the private sector. Maybe his poll numbers would have been higher today. Maybe he wouldn’t have lost the popular vote. And so while any single event might not necessarily rise to the level of disqualifying, if you put them together, then certainly he didn’t deserve to win.
Now, having said that, let me also say this. The reason why Mr. Trump won is because he got more votes than Hillary Clinton did. That means that millions of Americans voted for him despite everything. And they saw him as the right person to shake up Washington. They thought that he had the energy and the ability to negotiate with other world leaders. They felt like he cared more about their jobs than the career politicians in both parties did. And despite all the stuff that came out during the campaign, he still managed to attract over 60 million votes. Now, if those same voters had said, hey, actually, none of that stuff matters; we want someone who isn’t a politician; we just want to shake things up; we just want to drain the swamp; we just want to build a wall and
### Assistant: Make America great again, MAGA.
### Human: Exactly, MAGA, exactly right. Then I think he probably would have gotten elected. However, the fact that he lost the popular vote shows that most Americans were repulsed by what they heard from him and didn’t buy into his vision of America.
### Assistant: What is your view of the man himself?
### Human: Well, it depends on the day. Obviously, I disagreed with much of what he did during his four years in office, but unlike some former presidents, I tried to be civil with him. I reached out to him after leaving office. I’ll always remember the call where he wished Michelle and Malia happy birthday. We’re now good friends with members of his family. I invited him to the White House on the occasion of my daughters turning 18, where they spent time talking about college. And I know that he genuinely likes and admires First Lady Michelle Obama. So, overall, I was glad to see him leave office. But there were obviously plenty of times where I was frustrated with his decisions, particularly early on in his administration, before he surrounded himself with experienced professionals who knew how to run government.
