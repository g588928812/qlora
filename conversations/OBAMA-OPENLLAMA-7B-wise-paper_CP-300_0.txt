### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are we so divided today?
### Human: It's a good question. I think it's a complicated question. And I want to be careful about answering it because there's some things that I think have contributed to this divide, but I don't want us to lose sight of the fact that America has always had divisions around race and religion and class and geography and gender and political ideology and everything else. We are a nation built on division. So if we start thinking that somehow we've fallen apart and we canâ€™t come together and solve our problems, then we will be unable to meet these challenges. But what does divide us? Well, the obvious one is the political divide between Republicans and Democrats. And that was evident before Donald Trump came along. And I think that, unfortunately, that gap got wider during the course of my administration, partly due to changes in technology. That allowed people to express their opinions more openly, which has both been helpful in some ways, but also can create polarization if you see somebody you disagree with and they're saying something that strikes your nerves, you may not respond politely. You may say something back. And that becomes a feedback loop where people feel like they need to go further and further in order to be heard. And then the other factor that seems to have accelerated this is social media, which allows anybody to say anything anonymously or pretend to be someone else.
### Assistant: What do you mean by anonymous? Is it just online?
### Human: Anonymous means you can hide behind a pseudonym or a nickname or whatever. If I said something anonymously, nobody would know whether I meant it seriously or sarcastically or whatever. And that tends to lead people to say things that they wouldn't necessarily say face to face. Another factor is demographic changes. In particular, the growth of minority populations and the aging population in terms of baby boomers retiring and moving out of the workforce and leaving fewer jobs for younger workers. And when you combine those factors with a growing income inequality, then suddenly you get a situation where Americans feel economically vulnerable and uncertain about how the future is going to unfold, and they begin looking for explanations, blaming others. And unfortunately, politicians and cable news channels feed off of that anxiety, feeding into the fear rather than trying to calm people down and say, look, we'll figure it out.
### Assistant: Do you think it's possible to bridge the divides between left and right, between liberals and conservatives?
### Human: Yes. And let me explain why. Because at any given moment, most Americans agree on the vast majority of issues. They support raising taxes on corporations; they support spending money on infrastructure; they support expanding access to health care. And if all parties were able to work together on those basic principles, then we could address the bigger issues that we're facing now. The challenge is that our system doesn't encourage cooperation. Our electoral system encourages competition. And we end up with a winner take all mentality. Which is why after winning elections, members of Congress are far less likely to cooperate with each other and instead try to score points against their opponents and try to win elections based on dividing voters rather than bringing them together. But once elected, most people are willing to work together if they see that they share common interests and common goals.
So if Democrats and Republicans could put aside the animosity that exists between them, recognize that they actually share common values around wanting a stronger economy, wanting stronger national security, wanting better education for our kids and seniors alike, then we could move forward. But the problem is that too often people don't realize that they share common ground until they hear somebody else saying it. And then they feel compelled to defend themselves by attacking the opposition.
### Assistant: What do you make of the recent protests against police brutality and racism in America? Are these protests justified? Are they excessive? How do you balance the demands for justice against the safety and protection of innocent civilians?
### Human: First of all, I appreciate protesters exercising their constitutional rights and expressing their outrage over racial injustice in America. Unfortunately, some of them engaged in acts of violence. I understand why that happened. When police officers are killing unarmed Black men, when you see videos of white supremacists marching through Charlottesville chanting racist slogans, when you see kids locked away in cages, when you see young black children being stopped and frisked on the streets because of the color of their skin, when you see parents losing sons and daughters in Iraq and Afghanistan because they volunteered to serve their country, I understand why people are angry.
But as president, I couldn't ignore that anger either. I had to respond to it. And the response I gave was to send federal troops into cities to protect peaceful protestors from armed white supremacist militias. I sent federal marshals to keep the peace in Ferguson after Michael Brown was killed. And I used executive authority to investigate patterns of discrimination and abuse within law enforcement agencies across the country. So while I understood the anger, I also tried to channel it responsibly. And even though I didn't always succeed, I did make progress in reducing crime rates and improving policing practices.
### Assistant: What do you believe is the best way to reduce crime rates?
### Human: One thing that I think helped to drive crime rates down significantly in Chicago, Baltimore, New York City, St. Louis, and Washington DC was putting more cops on the street and having them interact directly with residents and businesses in communities that were suffering from high levels of violence. Those neighborhoods are safer today thanks to community policing programs. But I recognize that there still needs to be reforms in policing in order to ensure that law enforcement protects and serves everyone equally regardless of race.
