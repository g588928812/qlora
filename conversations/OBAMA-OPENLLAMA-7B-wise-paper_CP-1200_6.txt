### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does America matter? What's unique about this country?
### Human: Well, it depends when we started talking about “America.” If we mean just our physical territory, then obviously there are many countries around the world that have much bigger land mass than we do. So if we’re starting with simply geography, I think probably any number of other countries would’ve done just fine. But what makes us special is something more abstract. It’s our values. That is to say, our insistence that every single person regardless of their race, creed, gender, sexual orientation, has got intrinsic worth. And that they should be treated fairly and that the rules should apply equally to everybody. That’s what we consider America’s exceptionalism isn’t our size but that we’ve always taken these basic premises seriously even though sometimes imperfectly at times cynically. We’ve also tried to live up to those ideals so that even when we haven’t always succeeded, we’ve set the example for others around the world to try to emulate.
### Assistant: Is there anything particularly uniquely American about the way we go about living out those values? The pursuit of happiness seems like such an American ideal that maybe doesn’t translate anywhere else.
### Human: Yeah, well it may not translate everywhere else, but we’ve inspired people all over the world precisely because we’ve actually believed in those things. Even when we haven’t always acted in accordance with them ourselves, we still believe them deeply. And because we’ve been able to project that image around the world, people look at us and say, “Wow, those guys really seem to get it.” Now, that hasn’t always been true. Sometimes we haven’t lived up to our own hype. Other countries have looked at us and said, “You know, you talk about human rights and you talk about equality, but you sure don’t treat your black citizens very well.” Or we’ll say, “Oh yeah, you Americans, you got all this stuff. You got free speech,” but meanwhile you’re spying on everyone and no one knows about it. So yes, we’ve had our hypocrisies, but overall we’ve tried pretty hard to live up to our best instincts. And I think that’s why other countries have looked at us with admiration, some more than others.
### Assistant: How has the U.S. changed since you became president eight years ago?
### Human: Oh, it’s changed dramatically. When I came into office, we were still mired in a financial crisis. Our economy was on the brink of collapse. A lot of people lost their jobs. Unemployment was high. There were real problems overseas. We were going through a transition in Afghanistan. In Iraq, we had just pulled out most of our troops. There were ongoing civil wars in Syria and Libya. Russia was invading Ukraine and trying to redraw its borders, which hadn’t happened since World War II. China was asserting itself more aggressively economically and politically. It was a tough time globally, and we were still coming out of the Great Recession here at home. So when I walked into the Oval Office on the afternoon of January the 20th, 2009, the world was a very different place than when I took it over eight years later.
### Assistant: Can you describe what it feels like to be the first black president of the United States? Did anyone prepare you for that moment?
### Human: No, nobody could ever prepare anybody for that moment. And fortunately I didn’t let myself get too caught up in all the hype and speculation and analysis about whether I’d be good enough or qualified enough or whatever. For me it was just about doing my job and worrying about how I can serve the American people the best way possible. And once I got into office, I was focused on making sure that we got our economy back on track and that we addressed some of these longer term challenges like health care and energy policy and education. I did feel like during the course of the campaign and throughout the White House, I got a chance to meet a whole bunch of people who never before felt comfortable enough expressing themselves or saying hello to somebody like me or shaking my hand. And that meant a lot to me personally. I knew that it mattered symbolically and psychologically. But what I didn’t fully appreciate until I left the White House was how big of an impact my presence alone would have in terms of inspiring young kids who might grow up to be the next generation of leaders. And that’s been enormously gratifying because now we see this huge increase in diversity in Congress, state legislatures, city councils, and even corporate boardrooms.
### Assistant: What do you think it means to be an American today?
### Human: I think it means that anybody from anywhere in the world can come here and make it if they’re willing to work hard and play by the rules. And that’s certainly been true in my family. My wife’s parents came from small towns in Kansas. They both grew up dirt poor. Her dad worked in a slaughterhouse, her mom cleaned houses. And yet somehow they managed to save enough money to put her and her sister through college, and ultimately Michelle went to Harvard Law School. And while they weren’t wealthy, they instilled in us the belief that if you’re willing to study hard and take responsibility for yourself, you can accomplish absolutely anything you want. And that’s the essence of what it means to be an American, that anybody can rise as far as their talents will take them.
