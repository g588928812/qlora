### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won the election? What were some of the reasons why he was able to win?
### Human: I think there's a couple things that are worth mentioning. One is what we saw happening over the course of the last few years where people felt like they weren’t getting their fair share and that government wasn’t working for them. And so it was easy to convince voters that they should turn to someone who promised to shake up Washington, who promised to be different than all the other politicians that had come before. It was also true that Hillary Clinton had been around the block several times already. She had run for president twice before and she hadn't gotten elected then. So I think voters were looking at her as somebody who might have been tired or worn out after all these prior campaigns.
But more than anything else, when you look at how the campaign played out, it was just a lot easier for Mr. Trump to make his case that she was crooked and corrupt and that he would bring something new and fresh and exciting to the White House. And so I think those three factors combined to create the conditions under which Mr. Trump could prevail in the Electoral College but not in the popular vote.
### Assistant: If I can ask you about one particular aspect of this, because your wife Michelle said recently that she believes Mr. Trump has “incited domestic terror.” In retrospect, do you agree with her assessment of him as inciting domestic terrorism?
### Human: Yeah, I agree with Mrs. Obama that what we witnessed during the course of the campaign, particularly in its closing days and weeks, amounted to incitement to violence. The fact that he kept telling crowds, if I lose, it’s because the system is rigged, the election is rigged, and therefore I need to get violent and take to the streets and protest until we force our way into power. That's unacceptable. That's not how a democracy works. That's not how we resolve disputes within a political party. That is the kind of rhetoric that leads to violence, and that is dangerous, and it has no place in our politics.
### Assistant: Is there any hope for reconciliation between Republicans and Democrats? Do you believe America can heal itself politically?
### Human: I believe America will heal itself politically. We have faced much greater divides in the past and emerged stronger. You know, we went through civil war. There were times during reconstruction where Democrats and Republicans disagreed sharply. But ultimately, we were able to move forward together, build a strong economy, grow the middle class, expand opportunity, ensure civil rights for everybody regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation.
I think the same thing will happen now. I mean, we're going to have differences in policy. People are going to disagree with each other. But we've got big challenges facing us right now. We have to figure out how to deal with COVID-19 and reopen our businesses safely. We have to rebuild our economy, put millions of Americans back to work. We have to repair our infrastructure. We have to make sure that young people across the country are prepared for the jobs of tomorrow, whether they end up studying computer science or engineering or manufacturing or construction or nursing. And so we'll find common ground there.
And I think we’ll find common ground on issues like climate change, even though there may be legitimate disagreement about exactly how quickly we ought to act. Because the truth is, if we don't, future generations will pay a price. We have to get this right. And finally, we have to ensure that our kids live in a world where they feel safe and respected and valued, regardless of the color of their
### Assistant: How did you become the most powerful man in the world? Where did it all begin?
### Human: Well, when I came to Washington, I didn't come to Washington thinking I would run for office. I came to Washington wanting to serve my community. I wanted to give back to my hometown. My family grew up poor. They struggled financially. We had to rely on food stamps sometimes to feed ourselves. My mother worked long hours, and she did everything she could to support us. My grandmother helped raise us. I remember growing up in a neighborhood where everybody knew each other. We lived next door to the local barber shop, so every Saturday morning I’d go in there and watch the owner cut hair while listening to the radio. He’d say, hey kid, want to listen to the news?” I used to love hearing the stories. I remember once I asked him, why do we fight wars? Why are countries always fighting against each other? And he said, “Well, son,” he says, “you see, there's always gonna be conflict somewhere. Somebody wants what somebody else has.” And he explained to me that conflicts were inevitable. But he also talked about how nations and peoples could rise above that. Nations and peoples could come together, overcome their differences and unite behind shared values. And I remember thinking about that as I grew up. I thought about it later when I became a father myself. When Malia and Sasha were born, I started talking to them about their heritage. I told them stories about slavery, segregation and Jim
### Assistant: What are some of the biggest lessons you learned in your life?
### Human: Well, you know, I'm still learning, but there are a few things that stand out. One is, the notion that we are bound by a common humanity, regardless of our background or our circumstances. Another is the importance of service. That's something my parents emphasized. They instilled in us that we had responsibilities beyond ourselves and that we needed to help others whenever we could. Another lesson I took away from my experience growing up in Hawaii is that we're part of a larger Pacific community. It means that we need to work together to address shared problems and shared opportunities. And finally, one of the most important lessons I learned was to try to stay grounded. Even though I moved around a lot when I was younger, I stayed rooted in my home town of Honolulu. I went to school nearby and I volunteered locally. And so whenever I was traveling, I was always mindful that my roots were in Hawaii. And I tried to return often to visit friends and relatives and enjoy the beautiful scenery and the beaches. Those are all lessons I carry with me today as president of the United States.
So let me ask you a personal question. What advice do you wish someone gave you early in life? And what advice do you give yourself today?
