### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you want to be president? Why were you interested in this position?
### Human: Well, I've always thought that America was a special place; that we have this incredible capacity to bring together people who don’t look like each other but share common hopes and aspirations; that when we are at our best, we can overcome any obstacle. And so that’s what drew me to public service. That’s why I went into law, because I saw how government could make a difference. In my first job out of Harvard Law School, I represented poor folks in Chicago fighting against foreclosures. So even then, it wasn’t just about policy. It wasn’t just about legislation. It was also about changing lives. And I had seen examples of people who had lost their homes, who were struggling through some tough times, but they were able to get back on their feet thanks to somebody helping them. And that helped me understand the importance of government in providing opportunity for all Americans.
### Assistant: Is there anything about your upbringing that contributed to these values that you brought into public service?
### Human: Yeah, absolutely. My mother’s family came over from Kenya. They settled initially in Kansas City, Missouri, where my grandmother worked her way up from cleaning houses to owning her own business. Then she moved us down to Hawaii, where she grew up. My father was born in the south side of Honolulu to parents who met while working in the pineapple fields. But my dad enlisted in the army during World War II and ended up stationed in Alabama, which meant that he spent most of his life away from Hawaii. He didn’t grow up with Hawaiian culture. And yet, because he loved Hawaii so much, he spent a lot of time traveling around the islands, learning about its beauty and its diversity and its richness. He would take us on trips to explore different parts of Oahu, or Maui, or Kauai, or the Big Island. And those experiences exposed me to the wonderful traditions of Hawaiian culture. And I got to see how diverse Hawaii was. Hawaii is such a beautiful place, but it’s also really multicultural. There were Chinese kids who played basketball with me. There were Japanese kids who lived across the street. There were Korean families who owned restaurants nearby. We used to go to Chinatown every Sunday. So I had a chance to learn about different cultures and traditions growing up.
And then when I was in college, my mom became a social worker. She worked with single mothers and elderly people and immigrant communities. She
### Assistant: So it sounds like you grew up understanding the value of diversity, and appreciating the contributions of immigrants, especially African immigrants.
### Human: Absolutely. You know, I was lucky enough to spend lots of time with both sides of my family, so I had grandparents on both sides who immigrated. And it’s one reason why I believe immigration makes our country stronger. Our strength comes not from looking inward, but from looking outward. We are enriched by newcomers who come here from abroad. They bring new energy and new ideas, and they help us keep our nation young and vibrant. That’s something that I’ve tried to embrace throughout my career.
### Assistant: Do you remember the moment when you decided to run for president? What was going through your mind? Was it a decision that came naturally to you?
### Human: No, it actually took me a long time to decide. I started off running for Congress back in ’96, 20 years ago now. I ran for Senate twice. I contemplated running for governor of Illinois once. After my second unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives, I decided I wanted to try again, and I decided to run for the Senate. But when I won that election in 2005, I realized that the Senate doesn’t give you nearly the platform to advocate for issues that you can get in the White House. So after winning the Senate seat, I decided to run for president. I knew that it would be hard. I knew that it would require a tremendous amount of effort. But ultimately, I believed that I was capable of doing it. I believed that if I put my heart and soul into it, that I could become president. And I felt that I owed it to myself to pursue this dream, and I also felt that if I pursued it, maybe I could inspire others to do things they never imagined possible.
So I think that’s the spirit that drove me. I didn’t take a poll to figure out whether or not people wanted me to run for president. I decided to go ahead and do it because I thought I could make a contribution and because I thought it might motivate younger people to follow their dreams.
### Assistant: I guess you’re right. The whole world watched you, the entire globe, and you had this massive following. If someone wants to emulate you and pursue their own ambitions, do you have advice for them? How do they get started?
### Human: Sure. First of all, realize that you don’t need anybody else’s permission to pursue your dreams. Nobody should stand between you and your aspirations. Second of all, find mentors, people whose example inspires you, people whom you admire, who will support your efforts. Third of all, work incredibly hard. Put your head down, roll up your sleeves, stay focused. Don’t let yourself become distracted by the noise that surrounds us today. Stay true to your ideals. Be willing to listen to criticism, but also be prepared to defend those principles and stand firm on what matters to you. Lastly, be open to change and growth. Keep learning, keep developing new skills, keep challenging yourself. Because the more you stretch yourself, the more likely you are to achieve great things.
