### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did Donald Trump win the 2016 election? And what are some possible explanations?
### Human: I think there's no single answer. There were a lot of factors that went into it. You have a long tradition in our country of politicians who sort of trade on people's racial resentment. So we've had nativist movements before. We've had Know Nothing parties before. We've had Red Scares before. And so there's always this temptation sometimes when things aren’t going well economically, politically for somebody to say blame immigrants. Blame other folks across the color line. And then if they happen to be Muslims or Mexicans, it's even easier to do that. What was different about this case though, is not just the degree of animus but also the way in which those views were normalized over time. It used to be the case in America that people would say racist stuff at home behind closed doors and they might talk tough around their bar stool or around their beer keg after work, but they didn't take it seriously enough to really vote based on it. They didn't think it was something that could ever possibly lead them to elect someone president of the United States. That began to change during the course of the last decade or more because of changes in technology. You now can have your own personal echo chamber where you get all your news from one source. The rise of cable TV meant that everybody wasn't getting equal access to information. Talk radio gave people a megaphone to amplify their
### Assistant: narrow-mindedness and hatred and racism.
Human: Exactly. And then social media, particularly Facebook, means that you can find communities of interest who basically reinforce your preconceived notions about whatever it is that you believe. And so all these trends combined meant that suddenly you had a situation where large numbers of Americans felt like their political concerns weren’t being adequately addressed. They didn't feel respected. Their anxieties were being dismissed. They saw the economy going through hard times. Manufacturing jobs started leaving the country. People worried about terrorism. Then there was a whole bunch of foreign policy disasters overseas. In Iraq, we had an unnecessary war. Afghanistan got completely botched. Libya ended up in chaos. Syria descended into civil war. Boko Haram emerged in Africa. All these developments contributed to the idea that somehow America was losing its grip on the world stage and therefore it was in decline. When people feel like they're in decline, it makes it easy for demagogues to come along and suggest that everything is hopeless. We need strongman who's going to restore order. He'll put things right again. But then the third thing was the fact that while many people might privately harbor bigoted sentiments, they don't necessarily want to admit publicly that they are motivated by that. They may still go to church every Sunday. They may still live next door to somebody who's black or Latino or Muslim. And so part of how Trump
### Human: normalized all of this was by convincing people that he himself shared their prejudices but he would keep them to himself. If elected, he would surround himself with smart people who wouldn't let him down and actually implement sensible policies once he got into office. And so that created a dynamic whereby there were a lot of people out there who may have voted for him anyway, may have wanted to see him become president, but they certainly would never have admitted to anyone else why they were doing it.
### Assistant: Can we look at his policies without mentioning the personality of the man? Because it seems like he's gotten the brunt of criticism for the things he said rather than the actual policy positions he took.
### Human: Well, I think you can both do both simultaneously.
### Assistant: Oh sure. Absolutely. But the two together paint the full picture.
### Human: Right. And in any event, we obviously know what he believes and says and does. But it's important too to understand what he actually accomplished. Now having said that, I think we should probably spend less time on analyzing his character and more time on trying to analyze his policies.
### Assistant: Yeah. I mean, I guess it depends how much we enjoy listening to the same damn song played over and over again versus whether we learn anything new.
### Human: (Laughs) I agree.
