### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected president? And how did that happen? What were the forces at play? What was going through your mind during that time?
### Human: I'm glad you asked that question because it gets at something that we can all learn from. So there are lots of theories about why he was elected. There’s one theory that says this was an antiestablishment vote; people wanted to throw out the status quo. There’s another view which holds that maybe it was a protest vote against what seemed like an overly interventionist foreign policy, that people were tired of war after Iraq. There are others who say it was more of an economic issue. But I think that the single biggest reason that he won was simply that he had a better ground game operation than Hillary Clinton did. In other words, they weren't able to mobilize voters in the same way. That doesn't explain everything. You know, there were demographic factors. He benefited from some very unusual circumstances involving the Electoral College map, but I don't want us to lose sight of the fact that if we just consider purely the mechanics of the election, she had the superior organization. She had the superior candidate. She raised more money. Her husband came in and campaigned for her. It didn't add up.
### Assistant: So let's talk about those mechanics then. Can you talk about what is a good ground game operation? How does one get that right?
### Human: Well, it starts with understanding where your base of support is, whether it's rural voters or suburban voters, working class voters. If you understand that, then you have a much better sense of how to deploy resources strategically. Now, you also need to recognize when you're losing votes. When you're winning votes, you should be investing more heavily there. But when you're hemorrhaging votes somewhere else, you may need to cut back on certain areas where you aren't doing well so that you can pour more into places where you already look like you've got momentum.
### Assistant: So you mentioned fundraising and campaigning. What is fundraising? What is campaigning? What is the role of each?
### Human: Fundraising involves raising money. Campaigning involves communicating directly to voters. Both are important. They're different sides of the coin. Campaigning is critical. Without it, you can raise all the money in the world, but you can't reach enough voters without it. Fundraising is necessary. Even though I was outspent four to one in the general election, I still managed to win the popular vote, because I had a strong grass roots network of small donors who were willing to give whatever they could afford. Because I knew their names and where they lived, I knew exactly what to spend money on. I wasn't buying TV ads everywhere. Instead, I would send a field organizer to a town where there was a lot of enthusiasm and tell them to go door-to-door. The average contribution was $50 or less, which meant that every dollar went further. So while Hillary spent millions of dollars buying ads that nobody saw, I was getting more bang for the buck because I was spending my money smarter.
The only thing that really matters in any political contest is turnout. Turnout determines who wins elections. You can have all the money in the world, but if you don't have enough supporters voting for you, you'll never win.
So fundraising is absolutely essential, but it's not the endgame. Ultimately, you need to get people excited about your candidacy. And you can't do that unless you communicate directly
### Assistant: With the voters, yes.
### Human: With the voters. And grassroots organizing is what allows you to do that. So grassroots organizing is the nuts and bolts of politics. It's the work of registering new voters, persuading existing ones to come out and vote, and turning them out to vote. These activities are crucial for Democrats to compete anywhere outside of our traditional strongholds in urban centers like Boston, New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. We often take these things for granted because we live in them every day. But the truth is that Republicans dominate rural America and smaller cities and towns across America. And it's hard for Democrats to break through there without building up a local infrastructure. Grassroots organizers help make sure that Democrats can connect with potential supporters where they live.
And they also serve as a bridge between the party and its most committed members. So instead of relying solely on big donors or high-powered lobbyists, grassroots organizers keep us connected to ordinary Americans who believe in our values and want to see us succeed. So that's what they do. Grassroots organizing is absolutely vital to Democratic success. Without it, we wouldn't have won the White House in 2008 or 2012. And without it, we probably won't win again until at least 2036.
### Assistant: Do you have any advice for young people today who might want to get involved politically either locally or nationally? What do you think it takes to run for office or become a politician?
### Human: I think anybody who wants to get involved in politics needs to ask themselves three questions: First, what kind of impact do you want to have? Second, whom do you want to influence? Third, what role do you want to play? If your goal is to be a member of Congress someday, then you need to decide if you want to represent a district or a state. Then figure out what issues matter most to your constituents and develop a plan for addressing them. If you're looking for something more hands-on, maybe you want to work as an aide in Washington D.C., or even try running for school board or city council before making the leap to higher office later down the road. Whatever path you choose, the key is finding something that you care passionately about and giving yourself permission to pursue it no matter what anyone tells you. After all, politicians are supposed to be public servants. And if you truly want to serve your fellow citizens, then serving them means putting aside your own interests in order to do what's best for everyone.
What makes someone a great leader is not always having all the answers. Sometimes it's knowing when to listen to others and follow their lead. Leadership isn't about telling people what to do. It's about empowering them to do what's right for themselves and their communities.
