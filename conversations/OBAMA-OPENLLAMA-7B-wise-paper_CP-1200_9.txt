### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did democracy fail? during your eight years in office and today? And if we look at it that way, why do you think there's so much political division in this country?
### Human: Well, I would say there are many different ways to answer those questions, but let me just say what I hope we can agree on. is that these are not normal times. The fact that we have such deep political polarization right now doesn’t mean that things were fine before Trump got elected and then we all fell off the cliff. We were already teetering. There was a long period where the pendulum had swung too far in one direction because the post World War II consensus which was built around both parties basically accepting that America needed to be more active internationally, that we couldn’t just close our borders and everything would work out okay domestically. That consensus eroded over time starting back when Reagan became president. It accelerated under George W. Bush. You know, I ran into some people recently who said they didn’t really mind the Iraq war because they thought he was just trying to liberate Kuwait. But once we stayed there and then he invaded Iraq, “I realized that this guy wasn’t listening.” They weren’t necessarily liberal Democrats, although most of them probably ended up voting for me. But that kind of mindset that says, “We don’t need government. Government is always going to screw us somehow. So we might as well make sure that business interests get their fair shot instead of environmentalists or labor unions,” that was very real. And even though the vast majority of Americans still believe in the idea that government should play a
### Assistant: Positive role in society.
### Human: Absolutely. Not perfect, but positive. Even though we wanted a bigger safety net, even though we believed we could do better than mass incarceration, even though we believe in science and facts. And then the Tea Party movement came along and basically said, no, you know, the only problem with this country is that we’re spending too much money. Oh, except for defense spending, maybe we shouldn’t cut that. Oh, except for Social Security and Medicare, nobody should mess with that. Except for women’s rights, nobody should mess with that. And oh, yeah, except for gay marriage, nobody should mess with that either. Everything else is negotiable, apparently. And that was a pretty radical agenda. I’m not saying everybody who voted for the tea party was a bigot or belonged to hate groups, but there certainly were elements of that among them. And meanwhile, the Republican establishment decided they had to co-opt this new energy or else they were going to get taken over by extremists. So they basically said, “Hey, we’ll give you all this stuff about shrinking the size of government and making sure that we protect these core conservative values like gun rights and abortion, but we’re still gonna keep funding Homeland Security and we’re still gonna keep the troop presence in Afghanistan and we’re still gonna keep supporting Israel.” And they basically tried to thread that needle between the folks who were yelling loudest and the ones
### Assistant: Whoever was paying them.
### Human: Whichever group was paying them, exactly. And meanwhile, the center, which used to include most Republicans, but also a lot of Independents and centrists who just wanted to see something done about the budget deficit, they were basically left out in the cold. Then you fast forward through the next decade where Mitch McConnell basically decided his number one priority was to do anything he could to prevent any Democrat from getting elected president and then try to undermine whoever won whenever possible. Meanwhile, the country itself keeps changing demographically. Our population is younger, we have fewer white men without college degrees, and there are more immigrants coming in every day. At the same time, technology is moving faster and faster. Global competition is increasing. China is growing and rising and basically eating our lunch on a whole bunch of these issues. If you’ve got a governing coalition that basically consists of older white guys who are mostly from the South plus a bunch of smaller states whose main interest is cutting taxes and keeping regulations lax, that’s not going to last forever. And sooner or later you’re going to run into a brick wall. Now, that may happen anyway, regardless of whether someone like me is ever again elected president or whoever the next generation of leaders are. But that dynamic, it was already unsustainable. I never inherited a recession when I took over. When I left office, we were mired in a pandemic. Neither of those are the President’s fault. They’
### Assistant: Were they the fault of the Congress?
### Human: No, obviously not. But it does show how quickly circumstances can shift. I remember somebody saying after Lehman Brothers collapsed, “Well, nobody saw that coming.” Nobody saw it coming until it happened. That’s true. But anybody who was watching knew eventually something bad was going to happen because the system was so fragile. So yes, the political system failed. But it didn’t fail completely. A black man was elected President twice. That was historic. And despite all the nastiness and the ugliness that sometimes accompanied it, the American people ultimately concluded that the person they sent to the White House was Commander in Chief and deserved to be treated respectfully. I am proud of that, particularly since I spent eight years working alongside a lot of people who genuinely hated my guts. I take nothing away from that. I’d rather deal with people who are mean than indifferent, but there are certain moments where you realize, “Man, these people really want to see me fail.” And yet somehow I prevailed. And the reason I did is because even if there weren’t 50 million people who voted for me, there were enough people who fundamentally believed in the idea of progress and opportunity and equal treatment under the law, including myself, who said, “That guy actually seems like he means it. He seems like he wants to help. Maybe I should support him.” So that’s how democracy works. Sometimes it doesn’t work quite
### Assistant: the way we imagine it works.
### Human: Exactly. But that’s what makes it resilient.
So let’s talk about today. What are your thoughts on the current state of affairs?
