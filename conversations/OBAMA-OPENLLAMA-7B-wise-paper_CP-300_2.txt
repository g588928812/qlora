### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump became president?
### Human: Well, I think there's no one answer. But I will say this. One of the reasons that Donald Trump was able to get elected was because our politics had become so polarized. So when we look at how people vote these days, they’re almost exclusively partisan voters. There are some issues on which there may be crossover voters. But if you ask most people whether they would prefer a Democrat or a Republican, they have already made up their mind. They don't want to hear anything else about it. And because of that polarization, it meant that a lot of Democrats were going to support Hillary Clinton. It also meant that many Republicans were going to support Donald Trump. Now, what I did find interesting during the campaign, though, was that while both sides said “I don't like either candidate,” it wasn't true that everybody didn't like them. For example, in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, I was traveling around and campaigning. Even though everyone knew Hillary Clinton was going to win those states, I still saw thousands of people who came out to see us. Some of them were Republicans. Some of them were independents. Some of them were people who just weren’t enthusiastic about the prospect of having another four years of George W. Bush. Some of them just wanted to see someone new. And even though it looked like Hillary Clinton was going to win the election, there were enough undecided voters among those crowds who
### Assistant: That's a really important point. People were not thrilled with Hillary Clinton. That's right.
### Human: That was a key part of why she lost. If I hadn't gone to those places, I wouldn't have won. So there was a segment of the electorate who didn't want more of the same. And then the other thing that happened was that Donald Trump got better press coverage than Hillary Clinton throughout the entire campaign. The media gave him more attention. He was on TV all the time. She was not. And it seemed like every day something new came out about him that was scandalous. And so I think there was a level of fatigue and disgust with politics that contributed to his success. I think it also helped that Hillary Clinton ran such a terrible campaign.
### Assistant: You mentioned Hillary Clinton and her campaign. What was your relationship like with Hillary Clinton during the campaign? Did you meet often? Did you talk frequently? How much of an influence was she on your thinking about the presidency?
### Human: Well, my wife Michelle was a big fan of hers and was excited about her candidacy. My daughters were excited about it. So I spent a fair amount of time talking with Michelle and Malia about Hillary Clinton. And I watched her campaign speeches, read her books. She'd come to Washington once in awhile. We'd talk. She was supportive of what we were trying to do. When I took office, though, we decided that Michelle would continue to serve as First Lady and we would have a different arrangement where I would appoint somebody to be Chief of Staff instead of having a spouse serving. And so there was never any tension between myself and Mrs. Clinton over that decision. In fact, after I took office, I called Mrs. Clinton to let her know that that was the arrangement we would have.
### Assistant: Can you tell me the story of your meeting with Vladimir Putin?
### Human: Sure, I met with Vladimir Putin twice during my administration. The first time was when he was visiting Washington and he came to the White House. He and Mrs. Putin were invited to dinner, along with Prime Minister Brown of Britain. It was kind of a summit-style dinner where there were a number of leaders attending. Afterwards, Mr. Putin and I talked briefly in the hallway outside the dining room. Then we went into a larger meeting room where we discussed some bilateral matters and international issues. The second occasion was during the G20 Summit in St Petersburg. Both times, we found ourselves sitting next to each other. I remember looking across the table at him and realizing that he was smiling at me. And he asked, “What do you want?” And I told him, “Well, I’m running for reelection.” And he smiled again and said, “You’ll win.” And I thought to myself, well, that could only happen in Russia.
### Assistant: Was there anything specific that stood out about your interactions with Putin, besides the smiles? Because he seems like quite a character.
### Human: Yeah, I mean, Putin is a very smart guy. He understands power, and he understands how to use power effectively. He knows how to manipulate the levers of government. He understands what makes Americans tick. And I always enjoyed speaking with him. He speaks English very well. He reads a lot. He has a good grasp of foreign policy issues. And we disagreed on some things, but I never felt threatened by him.
