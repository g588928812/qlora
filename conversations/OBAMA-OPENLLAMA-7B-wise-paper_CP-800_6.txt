### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did democracy fail? And I'm talking about the failure that we saw during the 2020 presidential election cycle. What happened there, what are some causes of it, why did democracy not function properly?
### Human: Democracy didn’t fail, but our republican form of government was tested. It passed its test. We had a close election where people were legitimately concerned about whether there might be shenanigans. And in the end, we have a system which allows somebody like Joe Biden to be president because enough states felt comfortable doing their own count and certifying the results that they could trust. There wasn’t any evidence that this election was somehow stolen through fraud. But we still have these structural problems that make it possible for somebody to sow doubt about an outcome even though that outcome has overwhelming support among the voters.
### Assistant: So let's talk about the January 6th insurrection. In your view, what happened there?
### Human: Well, the events at the Capitol on January 6 were a terrible reminder of the fragility of our system of self-government. The peaceful transfer of power is one of the most defining features of our democracy. It is a foundation of the rule of law. If you can’t count on the peaceful transition of political authority, then everything else follows from that premise. That doesn't mean that every four years we don't have moments where there are legitimate questions raised about whether a particular candidate is fit to serve. We do those debates in public. We do them out loud. And hopefully, everybody respects the outcomes even when they disagree. But ultimately, if someone feels so strongly that they want to take up arms against the outcome of the election, well, that's an act of violence and it’s an assault on the entire system. And so what we saw on January 6 was an attempt to overturn a lawful election result. And fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and Congress certified Joe Biden as the next president. And then we proceeded to inaugurate him. But that was a moment when our system of self-government came under extraordinary stress. And it should give us all pause. You know, if you think about the fact that this country has endured for more than 230 years, that means it’s only been around for less than 5% of recorded human history. And so we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that this is the
### Assistant: Well, just to put a finer point on that, the reason it survived this long is because of institutions like the ones that failed during the 2020 election cycle. Institutions failed because of human beings and human nature. So if we look at the insurrection, if we look at the events of January 6, what went wrong?
### Human: Well, we're still learning how exactly that played out. But I will say this much: One of the things that makes America different from other countries is that we actually encourage free speech. Now, that doesn't mean that you can't be prosecuted for saying something that incites violence or defamation. But if somebody comes along and says, hey, there are going to be buses picking people up outside the capitol and taking them to jail. That's illegal. Even if you believe that they've got it right. That's spreading misinformation. That's an effort to subvert the results of an election. But we also recognize that we need to tolerate a lot of other stuff. People expressing themselves peacefully, having protests, trying to persuade their fellow citizens to see things their way. And that's a strength of ours. And the notion that anybody who wants to come and visit our shores and speak their mind freely would be welcome. That is one of the foundations of our system of self-government.
### Assistant: So what does that mean practically speaking? That means that people have a voice, people are heard, people get to protest, to argue, to discuss issues.
### Human: Absolutely. Look, I mean, we live in a representative democracy, and part of the way we check on our representatives is through elections. But sometimes it isn’t enough simply to elect somebody to office; we may want to change laws and shape policy. And so we rely on advocacy groups to try to convince lawmakers to move in a certain direction. And we also rely on the media to inform the debate and to help educate the general public. All of these things are healthy parts of our democratic process, and they should be protected. They should be able to exist without fear of reprisal. That said, none of that is meant to suggest that there aren’t limits to what people can say or do. And we have seen plenty of examples throughout U.S. history of folks who have advocated for positions that are racist or bigoted or anti-democratic. Sometimes they’ve done so openly. Sometimes they haven’t taken pains to hide their views. And we don’t always agree with them. But if they’re willing to abide by the rules, we should respect that. And again, that’s part of what distinguishes America from other places. We’ve always welcomed immigrants and refugees who want to come here precisely because we value freedom of expression and a diversity of opinion and culture.
### Assistant: So it's important to protect those rights of speech and assembly.
### Human: Absolutely. Those are fundamental pillars upon which our society rests. Without them, we wouldn’t last very long.
