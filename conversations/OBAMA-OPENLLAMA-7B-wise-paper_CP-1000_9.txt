### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won?
### Human: Well, I'll say this, I was wrong about him winning when I saw it happen. I didn't expect that outcome. But what I understood at the time and continue to believe today is that the reason why somebody like Mr. Trump became president was not just because of his personality flaws, which are legion, but also the fact that there was a deep sense among working class people that their concerns weren’t getting enough attention. And they were right. They hadn't gotten much attention over many years prior to Mr. Trump becoming president. And so, even though Mr. Trump didn't articulate any new solutions, he was able to convince these folks that he cared about them. Because he talked tough, because he insulted other folks, because he said things that they thought were true that nobody else had bothered to mention before.
### Assistant: So basically, populism can win elections no matter how bad of a job you do as a leader.
### Human: Yeah, yeah. And this goes back to our last conversation where we were talking about whether democracy is messy. And yes, it can be messy. And sometimes it leads to outcomes that may not be the most optimal. Now having said all that, and I don't want anybody listening to take away from this notion that somehow we should shrug our shoulders and say, well, that's just the way it works. That doesn't mean we have to accept it. You know, one thing that I learned during those eight years was that if you're willing to work hard, you can still make progress despite these obstacles. And, you know, sometimes it takes more time than you would like. Sometimes you need to compromise your principles. Sometimes you need to try to triangulate between different points of view instead of just sticking to your own point of view. But ultimately, if you've got strong convictions and you're willing to listen to others and you're willing to work together and you're smart enough to surround yourself with good advisers and then you get out there and you actually deliver results, voters will reward you with their votes.
### Assistant: It seems like you’re saying that you could have done better. Is that fair?
### Human: Oh absolutely. Absolutely. There's no doubt that we could have done better. We probably should have done better.
### Assistant: Do you feel personally responsible that some part of that happened?
### Human: No, no. Look, I think that anybody who gets involved in politics, especially if you’re somebody like myself who has spent their entire life in public service, the only real goal is to try to improve people’s lives. The minute you shift your orientation from trying to help people to thinking about how you score political points or how you win an election, you’ve lost something important about who you are. And so I always viewed myself primarily as someone whose responsibility was to serve the American people. I never forgot that throughout my entire career. And even though I wasn’t successful in every single area, I tried as best as I could to leave the country a little bit stronger and a little bit more hopeful than when I found it.
### Assistant: What did you learn about leadership from that experience?
### Human: Well, I think the biggest lesson was simply that no matter how talented you might be as a candidate or as a president, you can only go so far without a great team around you. I mean, you look at somebody like Ronald Reagan, who obviously was a larger than life figure, but he couldn't have accomplished anything without the right team behind him. Whether it was his wife Nancy, or his top economic adviser, Alan Greenspan, or his national security adviser, George Schultz. These folks provided him with advice and perspective and historical knowledge. And they helped him to see things in ways that maybe he wouldn't have seen otherwise. Similarly, you look at my vice president, Joe Biden, who was clearly one of the ablest politicians of his generation. He'd been in the Senate for decades. But he couldn't have done everything himself either. He depended upon aides who knew more than he did about foreign policy, about domestic policy. And similarly with our first lady, Michelle Obama. She was a terrific public speaker, but she needed her staff to research the issues and prepare the remarks and put it all into context. And I think that everybody underestimates the importance of having a strong team around you until after you’ve left office. I certainly learned that lesson. And hopefully now that I’m outside government, I’ll be able to devote more time to building a network of people who share similar values and beliefs and can come together and
