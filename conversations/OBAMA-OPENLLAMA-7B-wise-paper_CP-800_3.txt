### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump was elected president?
### Human: You know what? I think there are a lot of different answers to that question. So let’s put aside the fact that we live in an era where there are so many people who consume information primarily through their social media feeds and they get very little context or perspective. And then you’ve got cable news which is designed to be sensationalistic. And then the fact that this was a country that had not seen anything like the Great Recession in its living memory, combined with an electorate that was deeply frustrated, and frankly, angry about Washington in general and our political system. And then you have a candidate whose core message was essentially “I alone can fix it.” And the idea that he could wave a magic wand, whether it was health care or immigration or whatever else, and make America great again. And he did that by painting the other side as the enemy. He demonized immigrants; he demonized Muslims; he demonized women. And I think it worked. There were enough people out there who wanted someone to give them hope that somebody was going to solve their problems and that there wasn’t any more reason why things couldn’t just go back to normal. That’s how I would explain it. But when I look at the campaign itself, the one thing I will say is that there was no shortage of folks out there who said that if you want to understand why Trump won, go talk to those voters who didn’t vote for him last time around.
### Assistant: And that’s right.
### Human: Because he didn’t expand beyond the group that supported him last time.
### Assistant: What do you mean by that?
### Human: So he only expanded among Republicans. He lost independents by a significant margin last time around. And while it’s true that Hillary Clinton also lost some support within her base, she still won more than enough votes to win the popular vote. And so my point is simply that, yes, he did expand his coalition, but he didn’t expand it sufficiently to actually carry the day.
### Assistant: The popular vote versus the electoral college. Right. How does that happen? Is that something that happens every four years?
### Human: No. It hasn’t happened since 1888.
### Assistant: Oh. Wow. That’s crazy.
### Human: Well, it is true. In recent elections, there’s usually been some variation. Usually one person gets fewer votes than another. But the last time somebody came close to winning the majority of the popular vote and losing the election because they lost the Electoral College was Grover Cleveland in 1888.
