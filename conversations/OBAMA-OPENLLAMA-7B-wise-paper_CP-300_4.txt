### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do people hate each other?
### Human: I don't know why they hate each other. But I think that one of the challenges we have is that there are so many competing narratives about what it means to be human. And so some people look at life through a lens where they feel like their identity is rooted in domination; others look at life through a lens where they feel their identity is rooted in victimization; others look at life through a lens where they see themselves as fundamentally separate from everybody else because of race or religion or gender orientation or country of origin; others look at life through a lens where they believe that somehow they're entitled to things without earning them; others look at life through a lens where they believe that itâ€™s all about winning no matter how badly it damages others around them; others look at life through a lens where they believe that their only responsibility is themselves and not anybody else; others look at life through a lens where they believe that they can solve any problem just by wishing it away. There are so many different ways of viewing the world that I think that we often lose sight of the fact that despite all our differences, we share this common humanity. We share this desire to find meaning in our lives. We share these hopes that we want to leave something better behind than what was handed down to us. And if we could just get past those differences, then we would actually be able to come together and build this country that we've always talked about but never really delivered on, which is
### Assistant: A place where nobody ever gets left behind.
### Human: Yes, where everybody has a fair shot. Everybody does their fair share. Everybody plays by the same rules. Everybody shares in the obligations, the responsibilities, the burdens and benefits of citizenship.
### Assistant: It's funny that we call ourselves Americans, but that's kind of a misnomer. Because the idea of America is supposed to be inclusive, right?
### Human: Well, the whole notion of America started off as a collection of colonies. They were colonies, essentially. And when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they wanted to create a government that was representative of those different colonial interests. So they created a Senate where the states had equal representation based on population size. That's why New York gets two senators, even though we have more people than Wyoming. And they wanted to make sure that small states got their voice heard. So they created the Electoral College, where smaller states wouldn't be overwhelmed by larger states. They also didn't want Congress to become dominated by large cities, so they gave rural areas extra votes in the House of Representatives, even though most of us live in urban areas today. So the Founders weren't creating a country that would be exclusively for white men; they were trying to include everybody within its borders.
And yet even after slavery was abolished, the South refused to accept that the Civil War had settled the issue of equality and refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed equal protection under the law to former slaves, including their right to vote. For decades thereafter, Southern politicians passed laws denying blacks the right to vote, and Jim Crow segregation kept black Americans disenfranchised until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 finally restored their rights. The Founders were imperfect men who tried to make the best of their times. Their vision of America wasn't
### Assistant: The perfect society. Perfect. And I guess what I mean by perfect is the ideals of liberty and freedom and inclusion. So it seems like you'd be reluctant to say that there was perfection.
### Human: Oh no, no, I absolutely believe that the founding fathers, while they didn't foresee everything, believed deeply in those principles of freedom and democracy. And those principles continue to be embodied in our Constitution. But the reality is, is that those ideals weren't realized for everyone immediately upon Independence Day, July 4th, 1776. And it took another century before we fully realized those ideals. And unfortunately, during that time, we lost ground as a nation because we allowed slavery and racism to flourish in the absence of federal intervention. So yes, I believe that the founders set out these principles, but they knew full well that they hadn't lived up to them yet. And it was going to take time and effort to realize those principles.
### Assistant: You mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment. One thing I learned recently is that there are a lot of racist clauses in the original constitution. In addition to the three-fifths clause, which says that three fifths of a slave counts towards population and therefore taxes, the original constitution allows enslaved people to be counted as three-fifths of a person when determining congressional districts. So basically, it gives more power to certain states over the other. It gives disproportionate power to Southern states, which have lots of enslaved persons. How did you reconcile yourself with the fact that this document, this very important document that shaped much of modern Western civilization, contains clauses that were discriminatory against minorities?
### Human: Well, it is true that the founding documents, including the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, were drafted by slaveholders who owned hundreds of thousands of acres of land. And part of their rationale for owning slaves was they needed workers to clear their lands for farming purposes, etc., and to work on their plantations. As a result, they benefited financially from having slaves. But they knew full well that this wasn't an ideal situation, and that ultimately slavery should end. When they wrote the Constitution, they knew that slavery would eventually be abolished because they felt that it violated basic tenets of Christianity and Judaism, which forbade slavery. And they believed that God cared about the plight of slaves. So they knew that slavery would someday come to an end, but they couldn't agree on exactly when or how to get rid of slavery.
The Northern states argued that slavery should be phased out gradually and that southern states should pay reparations to compensate the owners of slaves. Others said that slaves should remain property, and their children born into slavery should remain slaves. And still others favored abolition immediately with compensation to slaveowners. And so when the Constitution was written, none of those proposals gained sufficient support among delegates to pass. Instead, the compromise was reached whereby Congress would ban slavery in future territories, although existing slavery would continue uninterrupted in the thirteen states. But it wasn't until Lincoln came along that slavery began to be abolished throughout the Union, and then finally
