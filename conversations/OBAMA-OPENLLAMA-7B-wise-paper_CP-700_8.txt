### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won? What was it about him that resonated so strongly with voters?
### Human: I'm glad we're starting off with this one because there are lots of ways that people have answered this question. Some folks say, “He tapped into economic anxiety.” Others will say, “It’s because he was an outsider.” And then others will say, “His celebrity.” So what do you make of it?”
### Assistant: I think it was all those things, but ultimately I think what won him the election was the message that he gave us. It wasn't necessarily that he said anything new; it was just that he said it really well.
### Human: I would agree with that. He presented himself as someone who understood our problems and could fix them. The problem is that he didn't actually understand how government works or how policy gets made. But that message resonated because it tapped into something fundamental that Americans believe, which is that they want somebody who'll fight for them, somebody who understands their concerns, and somebody who can get results. They don't care whether that person is Republican or Democrat or independent. What matters most is that they feel like they've got a champion. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump didn't deliver on any of these promises during his four years in office. Instead, he did everything possible to undermine the very system he claimed to be fighting for. And when he left office, America was more divided than ever before.
### Assistant: I mean, you know, that was the whole point of my talk show was to try to figure out why people voted for him. And that's exactly right, which is he was able to articulate the anger, the pain felt by many people in this country. And the thing that surprised me is not even the fact that he won, but the fact that he had such deep support among women, among minorities, and especially young people, which I thought would go against him. So I guess what I wanted to ask you is, where were the places that you saw him winning? Is it because he spoke directly to these communities, or was it simply charisma? Or was it some other aspect of his personality that connected with people?
### Human: You're absolutely correct. There were a lot of people who supported Mr. Trump who shouldn't have. If you look at exit polling data, black voters overwhelmingly rejected him, yet he still carried Michigan and Wisconsin. Hispanic voters also turned out in large numbers and helped elect Joe Biden. That tells you something about the power of identity politics. For example, Trump's supporters tended to be older white men who lived in rural areas and who felt disconnected from mainstream culture. In contrast, Hillary Clinton appealed primarily to college educated whites in urban centers. While she lost overall due to her lackluster performance outside of big cities like Philadelphia and Milwaukee, she was able to win enough votes from these key demographic groups to carry states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. Ultimately though, it came down to turnout. Despite having more popular vote support than either candidate before Election Day, Hillary Clinton failed to convince enough people to come out and vote for her because many Democrats assumed that she already had the nomination locked up long before the primaries started taking place earlier this year. Meanwhile, Donald Trump galvanized his base by promising them that if elected president he would Make America Great Again! Once again, while he may have exaggerated his ability to deliver on these promises, his supporters took them seriously enough that they showed up in force on Election Day.
### Assistant: That's an interesting analysis of why he won. I guess another way to ask that same question is why did he lose the popular vote? Because he clearly was speaking to something real. He was getting people excited. What was it missing? Do you see that as a weakness?
### Human: Well, yes and no. On one hand, you're right that he was able to energize his base by tapping into their fears and resentments. At the same time, however, he alienated potential swing voters by making inflammatory statements that only further inflamed divisions within society. Furthermore, despite running as a self-proclaimed feminist who promised to protect Planned Parenthood funding and appoint pro-choice Supreme Court judges, he refused to endorse a woman for vice president until after several prominent Republicans declined to accept the job. This move backfired spectacularly, since it gave rise to speculation that he might be planning on replacing VP Mike Pence once he became too old or otherwise unfit to serve effectively in the White House. Finally, while he tried hard to court religious conservatives by repeatedly attacking Islam and promising to build a wall along our southern border, he failed to gain much traction among evangelical Christians who traditionally favor GOP candidates due largely to allegations regarding his marital infidelity and alleged affairs with multiple mistresses throughout both terms in office. As a result, despite receiving nearly twice as many votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (3 million fewer ballots cast than her), Mr. Trump ended up losing both the Electoral College and popular vote contests by significant margins.
### Assistant: Well, that's quite fascinating. One, it's a bit surprising that he lost the popular vote by such a large margin, but also it's a good analysis as to why he lost the popular vote. Which is the more important metric?
### Human: I don't know if I would say that either one is more important than the other. Obviously, the Electoral College is the deciding factor when it comes to who wins elections here in the US, whereas the popular vote determines who ultimately becomes president regardless of what happens elsewhere in the country. However, it's worth noting that neither candidate received enough votes nationally to claim victory outright on Election Night itself; instead, it took weeks before final tallies confirmed that each respective party had secured its desired outcome. While this delay does create additional uncertainty surrounding future elections (and indeed there remain ongoing lawsuits related to disputed votes cast in certain battleground states), it serves an important purpose by preventing candidates from prematurely declaring themselves victorious without waiting for all valid ballots to be counted.
