### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are you so cool? What do we know about this secret? How did you become cool? I'm sure there was some struggle involved.
### Human: No, it wasn't a struggle at all. It came naturally to me. As a matter of fact, one of the things that I regret is when I left office, I gave away all my presidential memorabilia. So I don't have any cool stuff anymore. But yeah, I think it's just something that happened early on. I mean, I was always comfortable around people who were different than me. And then, frankly, I didn't take myself too seriously. When I started out, I had a bunch of silly haircuts.
### Assistant: What are your favorite memories of your time in the White House? You mentioned the inauguration. What else stands out to you?
### Human: Well, every day was memorable. The thing that stands out most to me was probably, as I said earlier, how hard our staff worked. They were incredibly dedicated to their jobs, but they also had such great fun doing them. There was a camaraderie between everybody. Even though we sometimes would argue over policy matters or whatever, at the end of the day, I knew that nobody really cared whether I liked them or not because they were working hard and they were focused on trying to do good work and make America better. That spirit permeated throughout the whole place. And I think that was what I found to be the most rewarding part about serving in government was seeing the talent of those folks.
### Assistant: One of the challenges I find fascinating about government service is the fact that many people are very talented and they want to serve their country, but then once they get into government service, they realize that they can’t leave because the bureaucracy gets in the way of their ability to actually do the things they care about. Do you see that problem? Or maybe that’s just me.
### Human: Oh no, I think you hit the nail on the head. Because if you come into public service thinking that you're going to solve all the world's problems overnight, you may be disappointed. I think what you learn instead is the importance of process. And sometimes the process itself is frustrating. Sometimes it slows things down. Sometimes there's disagreement within an agency. Sometimes somebody doesn't agree with a decision that you might have made. But I think ultimately what happens is you begin to appreciate that even if you can't solve every single problem yourself, you can still try to influence the direction that policy goes in. And so if you go in with that attitude, which is like, “Okay, well, I've got limited power, but I'll try to use that power effectively,” then I think you're able to weather that frustration much more easily.
### Assistant: You've spoken about your faith, Christianity, quite a bit publicly and privately. Can you talk about where does your faith come from, its role in your life today, and why is it important to you?
### Human: Yeah, absolutely. My faith is central to who I am. It informs everything I do, everything I say. I grew up in a household where religion was very important, both my mother and father were churchgoing people. Sunday school was a big deal. Going to church was a big deal. But I think even before that, I'd gotten a sense of the value of faith growing up on the South Side of Chicago. Where I lived, there was a real commitment among many families, religious families, to do right by each other. To look after each other. To try to help each other. To support each other. Whether that meant making sure the kids got to school, making sure the house was clean, making sure that parents weren't beating each other up. Just a sense of community, neighborliness, a willingness to pitch in and help. And I saw examples of that growing up. And I guess I absorbed that lesson, which is that regardless of whether or not you believe in God, it's important to recognize that your behavior should reflect that which you consider to be important, and that includes treating others fairly and decently.
### Assistant: What do you think is the best book ever written?
### Human: I wish I could remember the name of the book, but I read a biography of Abraham Lincoln while I was preparing to run for president back in 2006. I wanted to understand him better.
