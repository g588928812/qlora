### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did it take so long to get a black president?
### Human: Well, I'm glad we got one.
### Assistant: What was that like?
### Human: It was surreal. And not just because I had been working on this issue since the beginning of time. So I’d been involved with Jesse Jackson’s campaigns. I’d worked for other people. I’d done the usual sort of activist stuff. But even before I went into public service, there were moments where I would be sitting at a meeting and someone would say, “Well, why don’t we have a black president?” And I would go, “Oh.” And then they’d say something else. You know what I mean? Like, “Why are there no Asians running for office?” Or “Where are all these women?” Or whatever. Because everybody knows somebody who should run for office. Everybody knows somebody who could do better than their current representative. Nobody ever thinks about those things until someone comes along who actually does it. And so it was both a little bit surreal because, frankly, if you look back over our history, it hadn’t happened yet. And it also felt familiar in ways that I think were really encouraging. Because I knew how much work needed to happen once we got him elected. That wasn’t going to be enough. We weren’t going to suddenly get some magical legislative package passed simply because he had gotten the Oval Office. There still had to be a whole bunch of organizing and hard work that needed to happen afterwards. But what was exciting was knowing that now we didn’t have to talk anymore about
### Assistant: The glass ceiling; we shattered the glass ceiling.
### Human: We shattered the glass ceiling, which meant that now there were more opportunities out there for people who otherwise might not have thought seriously about doing this kind of thing. And it also meant that young girls and boys around the country saw themselves differently. They said, “If he can become President, maybe I can too.”
### Assistant: And also that there’s finally some hope that America will elect a black person as president. Yeah. How do you feel about Hillary Clinton losing?
### Human: I was disappointed. She obviously was very gracious after she lost. I was proud of her campaign. I think she ran a great race. It was tough for anybody to beat Donald Trump. He was an unconventional candidate. There’s no question about that. But she had every advantage. She had money. She had experience. She had name recognition. She had organization. She had a track record of having helped people. I mean, she literally wrote the book on how to help kids who grow up in poverty. She came from a family of tremendous accomplishment. So she was well positioned to win the election. Unfortunately, despite all those advantages, she lost. I don’t want to second guess anyone’s decisions. Obviously, there are lots of theories about what may have caused her loss. I won’t try to speculate about whether any of them are true or false. I’ll leave that to others. All I know is that she ran a heckuva campaign. And while we may disagree about the outcome of the election, nobody can doubt her commitment to this country.
### Assistant: You mentioned she wrote a book called Living History. What was your relationship with her during those years? Did you guys talk often?
### Human: Well, yes and no. I spent a lot of time with her in the White House. I mean, you can imagine when you’re trying to govern through multiple crises, sometimes you need to bring in extra advisers. Sometimes you need to bounce ideas off each other. Sometimes you need to share information. Sometimes you need to get advice from folks who aren’t necessarily in your immediate inner circle. Sometimes you need to make sure that everyone feels included in important decision making processes. So she and I became close friends. But honestly, we probably talked less about policy issues than we did about raising our families. Because we both had young children during most of the eight years that we were in the White House together. And we would talk about what it means to be raising daughters or sons. We would talk about what it means to be parents. We would talk about how challenging that job is, particularly during periods of crisis. And we were able to commiserate with each other about that because neither of us had biological children ourselves. So we understood that aspect of parenting without having gone through it ourselves.
