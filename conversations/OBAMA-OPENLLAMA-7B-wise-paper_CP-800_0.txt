### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does it seem like there's more hate and polarization in this country than ever before? We can point to different events that contributed to this feeling. What do you think about why it seems so bad right now?
### Human: I don’t want to minimize how bad things feel right now. But we shouldn’t get trapped in this idea that the world is getting worse. It isn’t. And if we take time to look at where we were even 50 years ago when Dr. King was assassinated, we’re living better lives today than we did then. And that includes our kids’ lives. That means they have a chance to live longer. They have greater economic opportunity. There are less people who are hungry. The list goes on. So what is true is there are still challenges out there. There are still problems that we need to solve. But what we should be able to agree on is that these are solvable problems. Even the most intractable problems can be solved. They just require us to put forth the effort and to work together.
### Assistant: But the way that we talk about them matters too. So if you say we are experiencing unprecedented division, polarization, hatred, etc., it makes it sound like there's something new under the sun. But there hasn't always been hateful rhetoric, and there haven't always been deep divisions in America. There may be deeper divisions than usual right now, but they've existed throughout our history.
### Human: Yes, absolutely. Racism has been a part of our DNA since day one. Slavery has been woven into the fabric of this nation from its inception. And although we have taken some steps forward, we have also taken some steps back. In terms of the last few decades, I would argue that we have made progress on many fronts, including racial progress. But we still have a long ways to go. And we know this because we know that the gap between black and white unemployment rates remains wide. We know that too many families in communities across the country still lack access to quality education and job training programs. Too many parents worry about their children not getting a good education. We know that health disparities remain a challenge. And so we know that there is still much more work to do. At the same time, however, I would caution against this idea that somehow we are experiencing more racism or we are experiencing more divisiveness than we used to. Because we simply aren’t. We are better off than we were before. I mean, there are fewer racially lynched folks today than there were 50 years ago. We are a far more integrated society today than we were 50 years ago. We have elected African Americans and other minorities to serve in higher office than ever before. We have more women serving in Congress than ever before. And so while there are still challenges, and there will continue to be challenges, there are also real reasons to hope and
### Assistant: One thing that worries me is the loss of civility, especially on social media. You mentioned health care and other issues that affect the entire population, whereas social media often pits us into camps where there's just anger toward each other. Do you see any value in civility online? Any value in trying to keep cool heads in political discourse?
### Human: Well, I'm not sure I believe that the answer is “no.” I think that there are times where people ought to be passionate about their concerns and their views and what they care about. Obviously, I believe that everybody ought to be able to speak their mind without fear of retribution. However, I do think that there are some basic rules of engagement that we need to follow. One of those rules is that you don't try to silence somebody else. That's not the purpose of debate. Debate is supposed to help us learn and hopefully make us smarter. It's not designed to silence anybody. Similarly, if someone says something you disagree with, you don't necessarily have to go around telling them that they're stupid or that they're wrong. There are some basic rules of decorum and respect. And if we all followed those, I actually think it could improve the tone and quality of public discourse. But I think there's no reason that people can't be passionate, particularly when they believe passionately in the things they care about.
### Assistant: Yeah, that's why I love Twitter. Sometimes the people who are passionate and opinionated are the best ones to express themselves online because they can cut through BS quickly and efficiently. Like you said, sometimes passion is the best thing. And so if you're going to have civility, it should only happen after a lot of passion.
### Human: Absolutely. I mean, I think one of the things that's happened in recent years is there has become this sense of needing to be liked. Whereas traditionally in politics, you might have disagreed with somebody politically, but you didn't necessarily have to be rude about it. That's unfortunate. I mean, ultimately what we need to do is to find common ground wherever possible. And you know, there are plenty of areas where we disagree on policy. But, you know, I think that if we can find areas where we agree and maybe compromise on certain positions, that's probably the best outcome we can achieve. If we can't do that, then I guess we'll just have to settle for gridlock and dysfunction.
### Assistant: And that's why bipartisanship is important. And unfortunately, it seems like both parties have abandoned bipartisanship.
### Human: Yes, that's certainly part of the problem. And I think that we need to encourage members of both parties to reach out and engage with each other in constructive dialogue instead of simply demonizing whoever happens to be over there in the other party.
