### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we have so many problems in this world? What's at the root of it all?
### Human: Well, I think there are multiple things that are at the root of our problems. But if we look at it purely through the lens of economics and materialism, one thing that we know about human beings is that when they don’t feel like their lives are going well, they tend to be pretty down on themselves. And then if they’re feeling down on themselves, they’re not gonna do much except maybe lash out in some way against other people. So if you just go strictly on the basis of what makes sense economically, it would say that people will only work hard when they believe they can make something happen. If they don’t see any hope for them personally, they won’t try very hard to move ahead. And if they’ve got enough to get by, but not enough to get ahead, they’ll grumble and gripe and complain instead of doing anything constructive.
Now, obviously none of us want to live in a society where everybody is just miserable all the time because nobody feels like they’re getting anywhere. We need to give folks enough economic security so that they don’t always feel like they’re hanging over a precipice. But we also know that if folks don’t feel like they’ve got a stake in somebody else’s success, they’re never going to share broadly in America’s prosperity. They’re not going to invest in their own kids’ education; they’re not going
### Assistant: You’re talking about the individual level. Yeah, yeah. How do we solve these problems then?
### Human: I think part of it is helping people recognize their common humanity. One of the reasons why I was driven into public service myself was I felt like growing up as a kid in Hawaii, even though there were lots of different nationalities around me, somehow everyone seemed to be assumed to be basically alike. It was easy to understand each other without having had gone through years of formal education together. That’s how most families operate. Even within extended families, you might not all have graduated from high school, let alone college, but somehow you still seem to function pretty effectively as a family. But once you go into larger social structures where there aren’t necessarily commonalities in terms of shared experiences, there seems to be more potential for misunderstanding and conflict. And so I think one of the jobs of government is to help build those bridges between communities so that we better understand each other. Because if you really do understand someone else’s point of view, you may disagree with it, but hopefully you’re less likely to demonize that person.
### Assistant: The empathy piece, absolutely. There’s a lot of talk about “us versus them.” There’s a kind of tribal mentality among humans. How do we break apart that “us” and “them”?
### Human: Well, again, I think there’s a role for government. Government has a responsibility both to create the conditions whereby people feel like they belong to a community, and secondly to enforce certain core values and certain basic expectations that no matter whether you grew up here or whether you came here yesterday, you should expect to be treated fairly. That’s not something that I think any government can guarantee. Every government screws up sometimes, but I think we can strive towards it. We can do a better job than we currently do of making sure that every child regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, creed, sexual orientation, that no matter where they come from, they’re given a fair shot in life.
### Assistant: That’s such an interesting idea of belonging to a community and that government creates the environment for that. Because you’re saying that you don’t necessarily have to agree with someone else’s values, but you do have to belong to a community with them.
### Human: Right, and I think that that’s actually pretty rare today compared to past generations. I mean, when I grew up, there were kids who didn’t speak English as their first language in almost every classroom I went to. Today, depending upon which city you’re in, generally speaking, that isn’t true anymore. But what does remain consistent is that wherever you go nowadays, whether it’s New York City or Des Moines, Iowa, you’re still going to find people who are members of a particular religion. And sometimes they don’t all worship exactly alike, and yet they’re all part of the same faith tradition. Or you’ll have people whose parents immigrated from Mexico or Central America, but they weren’t born in Mexico or Central America. Their grandparents might have been, but they weren’t. And so I think if we can just make sure that everybody feels like they’re part of something bigger than themselves, that’s probably the best chance we have of avoiding some of the ugliest forms of behavior that we’ve seen throughout human history.
Well said. And we talked about this earlier, but immigration is another issue that’s near and dear to your heart. And so how can we fix the broken system of immigration in this country?
### Assistant: Immigration is another issue that’s near and dear to your heart. And so how can we fix the broken system of immigration in this country?
### Human: Well, I think the current immigration system could use a lot of fixing. It doesn’t reflect the realities of today’s economy. A big part of the problem is that we’re bringing in far fewer immigrants overall than we did historically relative to our population size. And meanwhile, countries like China and India, whose populations are growing quickly, are sending larger numbers of workers to other developed nations. So unless we make changes to our immigration laws, we risk having too few new arrivals coming here to keep pace with the needs of our economy. At the same time, we want to make sure that anyone who wants to come here legally has a pathway to do so. Unfortunately, right now there are millions of undocumented immigrants living in this country who shouldn’t be here. They broke the law when they arrived. And while they’ve since paid their taxes and become productive citizens in many cases, we can’t ignore the fact that their presence here is unlawful. So I strongly support efforts to modernize our legal immigration system and provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here. But we also need to beef up border enforcement and make sure that we’re using technology to prevent people from simply walking across the border illegally. Finally, we need to do more to address the root causes of migration. If people are fleeing poverty or violence in their home countries, they’re not likely to stop until either they reach safety elsewhere or they die trying
