### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think there's so much hateful rhetoric against Donald Trump? I'm not talking about his policy positions; I'm talking specifically about hatred that seems to come out of nowhere, seemingly irrational hatred.
### Human: Well, I don't know if it comes out of nowhere because obviously we all have our own prejudices and stereotypes and biases. And some of them are probably rooted in experiences that happened to us when we were kids growing up. So there might be a little bit of that going around. But what is clear to me is that the rise of social media and the fact that people can say whatever they want without any accountability, without any consequence. Because the truth is, even though Twitter has taken away my ability to reach millions of followers overnight, and Facebook may take away my ability to communicate with people through groups, I still am in a position where I can talk directly to people, and so there are limits to how effective these platforms are at removing voices. But nevertheless, the idea that somebody could just spew something out into the world and then walk away and nobody knows whether that was true or false, everybody accepts it as true or false based on their own feelings and their own experience, is something that I think has unleashed forces in America that are genuinely troubling.
### Assistant: You mentioned social media and its role in this. I mean, I think social media played such a large role during your presidency in terms of communication. Do you see that as a positive or negative force in society today? What do you make of it?
### Human: Social media is neither good nor bad per se. It's like a double edged sword. If you’re using it in moderation and it’s helping you connect with other people and you feel empowered as opposed to isolated, then it’s a great thing. On the other hand, if you’ve got somebody who’s a narcissist and they’re using it to reinforce their sense of self importance and feed their ego, then it can be toxic.
### Assistant: In both cases, the same platform, but the way you use it makes a difference.
### Human: Absolutely. That's why it's important that parents teach young people how to use it properly. We can’t expect teenagers to figure it out on their own, especially teenagers who are living in isolation, who maybe aren’t getting enough attention from their families, who are feeling disconnected from the real world.
### Assistant: Is there something you wish you had known before becoming president about the power of social media? Or did you learn along the way?
### Human: I would have liked to have known more about the potential pitfalls of it earlier on. And I think the reason is, I started my career as a community organizer on Chicago's south side, which meant that I spent most of my time trying to convince people to register to vote and go to the polls and help elect local officials. And so I understood very early on that the single most powerful nonpartisan tool we have is the ballot box. And over the course of years and decades, politicians learned how to manipulate and gerrymander districts and draw voting lines in ways that made it harder for people to participate. But even then, I never thought that social media could actually undermine the integrity of our elections. I certainly didn't anticipate how polarized things would become.
### Assistant: Do you think there will ever be another Black man elected president of the United States?
### Human: Yeah, absolutely.
