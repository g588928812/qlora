### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does America work?
### Human: I think America works because it's a nation that has at its core certain values that are about human dignity; it's also about people coming together around common interests and pooling their resources so they can achieve things collectively that they couldn’t individually do; and then we have this system where we vote and we participate and nobody gets a free pass just because they were born into wealth or power. That idea of everybody having skin in the game and everybody participating, that gives us our edge. But what we've seen over time is those bedrock principles get frayed when there's no sense of responsibility not just on the part of individuals but also on the part of business leaders, politicians, everybody. And if you don't feel like you need to play by the rules yourself, why should anybody else? If you believe that somehow somebody else is going to bail you out regardless of whether you act responsibly or not, well then eventually all those other folks will be looking for someone else to bail them out too. So I think that one of the challenges right now is we haven't really updated ourselves as a country to deal with changing circumstances and we're still operating largely on the same playbook that was written back during World War II. And that playbook obviously worked well enough to keep us prosperous after the war. It also kept us safe during the Cold War. But now we find ourselves in a different world. The single biggest challenge we face is neither China
### Assistant: nor Russia, although both are very important. It's at home. It's dealing with this pandemic.
### Human: Well, I would actually say that the domestic issue that we face, even more than the pandemic, is the economic dislocation caused by globalization and automation. You know, when I came into office, most economists thought that the problem we had wasn't jobs, it was skills. We needed to retrain workers and make sure they could compete with new technology. What I didn't fully appreciate then was how much the combination of globalization and technology would make some jobs simply disappear, particularly jobs that used to require a high school education or less. There are only so many truck drivers you need in any given economy, and while some of them may transition to other careers, many others end up competing for jobs in the lower rungs of the service sector, which often pay less and don't provide benefits. And unfortunately, wages overall haven't gone up as fast as productivity. And so what you see is a lot of people who feel left behind by the current economy and are understandably frustrated and maybe angry. I mean, look, we're only 50 years or so removed from Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement. We're only 30 or 40 years since women got the right to vote. So it's understandable that people are skeptical of institutions and government and the whole notion of “us” and “them.” If you grew up during the Depression or segregation, your experience was real. And it's hard to imagine that
### Assistant: things were better before, especially when you didn't have a way to verify that things were better before unless you actually lived through it.
### Human: Exactly. And it's also hard to remember that life in the late ’60s and early ’70s was hardly perfect either. I mean, we had race riots and Vietnam and Watergate and double digit inflation. So, you know, there's always been conflict and upheaval and pain in our society. But if you look at the arc of progress, we've come a long way. And hopefully, you know, young people growing up today won't bemoan the fact that everything sucks. They'll probably look around and say, hey, these guys did pretty good! (laughs) Because we've made strides, even though we continue to struggle with problems that existed long before I took office. So the key is for us to stay true to our founding ideals, which is not to pit one group against another, to try to build a more inclusive economy where everyone feels like they’ve got skin in the game and plays by the rules, and where everyone has a role to play in making things happen. And that means that, yes, sometimes we’ll be protecting the interests of big corporations, but it also means that we’re gonna ask them to share their profits a little bit more so that working families are getting a fair shake. And we want to encourage small businesses to create jobs, but we also wanna make sure that their employees aren’t working 60 hours a week without health insurance.
### Assistant: One of the things that happened during the COVID-19 pandemic that I find fascinating, perhaps you can explain why, is the complete turnaround of image of the federal government. Nowhere is this more clear than when comparing Donald Trump versus Barack Obama, but also just throughout American history. Just compare the amount of trust Americans put into the government. So basically, from 2008 until 2016, almost all the time, the vast majority of Americans trusted the government. When Obama took over, it was about 60% saying they trust the government. Then suddenly when Trump started talking about, "Oh, we shouldn't trust the government," it went down to below 40%. And then when Biden became president, it went back up above 60%, which is a remarkable difference in such a short period of time. Why do you think this is? Do you think that's a healthy development? Is this something you expect to go away anytime soon?
### Human: No, I think it's perfectly normal and healthy for there to be periodic spikes and dips in confidence in government. And clearly there was a huge spike in confidence during the Second World War when we rallied around FDR. Confidence in government has waxed and waned since then. It's interesting that it tends to fall off during times of peace and prosperity because when things are tough and you're worried about keeping your job or feeding your family, you're willing to give the benefit of the doubt to whoever seems to be the most competent and is promising to help you. Unfortunately, it's also easy for demagogues to convince people that the real source of their problems isn't the private sector or themselves. It must be the government. It must be immigrants or minorities or whatever it happens to be. And once people start believing that, it becomes harder for them to summon the will to take on entrenched interests and fix what needs fixing. So yeah, I think it's natural to have ups and downs in terms of people's confidence in government. But ultimately I do think it's important for people to believe that public servants are acting in good faith and trying to do the right thing. And that means we need to root out corruption wherever we find it. And that doesn't mean we have to agree on exactly whose ox is gored at any given moment. Sometimes we might disagree with policy choices that a particular administration
### Assistant: makes. But fundamentally, they seem to be acting in good faith.
### Human: Right. Otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in having elections. And that goes for presidents, but it also goes for members of Congress, state legislators, local officials. If people don't believe they're doing the right thing, then why bother electing them?
