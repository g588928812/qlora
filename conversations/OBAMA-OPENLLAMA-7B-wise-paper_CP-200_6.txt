### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do people love you so much? What are your thoughts about that?
### Human: Well, I think it’s because we need somebody who can make us feel good, right? And I’m not just talking about politicians; anybody who gets into public life has got to be able to give people hope and reassurance and inspiration and maybe even laughter and joy. And I certainly try to do those things. But ultimately what makes me happy is when I see ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things to try to improve their communities and improve themselves. That gives me tremendous satisfaction. Because there’s no doubt that America faces enormous challenges. We have a society where we’re increasingly divided by race, class, geography, ideology. The political system seems broken. There’s this notion that if only one side is willing to compromise or negotiate, then all will be well. That’s a false premise. That’s why I say we have to get out of this mindset that everybody needs to agree. Everybody doesn’t have to agree. If everybody agrees on everything, then there’s nothing left to argue about. Right? So let’s have disagreements but recognize our common humanity. Let’s recognize our obligation to each other. And I think if you look at some of the stories of Americans overcoming adversity that you read about every day, they don’t just inspire me. They inspire everybody else too.
### Assistant: How would you define success? Is there something that defines success for you?
### Human: Success is measured against yourself. It’s measured against your own expectations. So you know, if I had told you when I was eight years old, “Someday you’ll run for president,” you know, you wouldn’t have believed me. Even though it seemed possible to you as a child, I mean, how many presidents did you hear of growing up? One! You didn’t really imagine that somebody like you could ever run for office. So if I had said, “You’re going to become president someday.” Success would be defined differently than it would if I’d said, “When you grow up, you’re gonna be a doctor or lawyer or whatever.” Success would be defined differently depending upon whether you set high enough standards for yourself or not.
### Assistant: So you have to dream big dreams and reach them.
### Human: Yeah, I think that’s true. I think if you set goals and you aim high, you’ve gotta expect to fail along the way. Failure is part of the process. You learn from failure. You have to be prepared to accept failure. Failure is part of growth.
### Assistant: How would you describe your personality? Are you optimistic? Do you see the glass half full or half empty?
### Human: Well, I’m hopeful. Hopeful is important. Optimism is more of an aspiration. Hopefulness, you know, optimism may be based on some wishful thinking. Hopefulness recognizes the fact that reality does exist. Hopefulness looks forward to the future, while optimism tends to be more retrospective. Hopefulness acknowledges problems but believes they can be overcome. Optimists tend to deny problems exist until someone points them out. Hopefulness accepts that we won’t always succeed but believes we should keep trying. Optimism assumes that we’ll succeed eventually. So I think hopefulness is more realistic, but it also requires action.
So let me ask you a personal question. When you were elected as president, did you ever feel overwhelmed? Were you afraid of failure? Did you worry about what might happen if you failed? Or were you confident that you were going to succeed?
### Assistant: I was very confident. In retrospect, I probably underestimated what it took. And maybe that’s a mistake I’ll make again. But I definitely felt strongly about the direction I wanted to go. And I felt strongly about my values and ideals.
### Human: What gave you confidence? Was it your background? Was it family? Was it friends? People who supported you? Your wife Michelle?
Yeah, yeah. My parents, obviously. Both sets of grandparents. Michelle. Friends and colleagues. Folks who I knew were smarter and better educated than me, folks who’d done harder jobs than me. I think I drew strength from knowing that if I couldn’t do it, nobody could. So I felt pretty confident.
