### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we live in a democracy?
### Human: Because it’s the best way to run things. I mean, that’s kind of obvious. You know, if you look at history, what happens when dictatorships arise? They don’t last long. People rebel against them. Sometimes they get killed; sometimes they go out and fight and rebel. So, yes, there are flaws. There are ways in which democracy can be corrupted. But I think that the fact that we have this tradition that we are all equal citizens before the law, we have these institutions like free press, independent judiciary, elected representatives, that makes our country stronger than any other system that’s ever existed. And so, you know, it’s not perfect; nobody says it’s perfect. And yet, despite its imperfections, I still believe that, even after all the mistakes we make, that this is the right thing to do because ultimately it gives us more freedom and dignity. It’s better for us individually. If you want your kids to grow up safely, then you need a government that cares about their safety. If you want your business to thrive, you need a government that helps protect intellectual property rights, protects markets, ensures that there’s some degree of predictability, stability, that allows entrepreneurship to flourish.
### Assistant: But you’re talking about individual benefits. Isn’t it true that democracy benefits society at large as well?
### Human: Oh absolutely. Democracy provides a framework within which people can pursue their own interests, but also collectively pursue common goals and solve problems together. And when you look around the world, whether it’s poverty, whether it’s environmental degradation, whether it’s pandemics or epidemics or climate change or terrorism or migration or nuclear proliferation or nuclear weapons, the greatest threat to humanity is the inability of us to work together and find solutions. So, no matter how much progress we may make on each one of those issues individually, unless we figure out how to cooperate, unless we figure out how to share ideas, unless we find ways to listen to each other, and particularly to vulnerable populations around the world that are impacted by these challenges, and come together around solutions, then none of those efforts will succeed. And that means that even though I might personally benefit if we were able to address climate change, and if we had a strong social welfare net, and if I was guaranteed health care, that doesn’t mean that the next generation won’t face greater threats because we didn’t pay attention to global warming. That doesn’t mean that we won’t be dealing with new diseases that emerge from Africa because we weren’t paying enough attention to global health security. Those kinds of failures affect everyone.
### Assistant: The same way that individual liberty affects everybody else in society, too.
### Human: Exactly. So, the whole notion of liberty itself comes back to that idea that it enhances our capacity to participate in democratic societies and to live lives where we’re safe and secure and healthy and prosperous. It’s not just a luxury, it’s a necessity.
You know, I grew up, you know, in Hawaii, where I spent most of my childhood outdoors. You know, we played baseball. We played basketball. We went surfing. We skipped rocks across streams. You know, we climbed trees. And I remember thinking to myself, “How lucky I am,” you know, “to have grown up in this environment.” And I think part of why I became interested in public service is precisely because I knew I wasn’t going to enjoy that experience for every child growing up today. Every kid isn’t going to get to play outside. Kids are spending less time playing outdoors. Kids are sitting in front of screens, staring into devices. They’re losing opportunities to interact with nature. They’re losing opportunities to develop skills that will help them contribute to society. They’re becoming disconnected from community life. And all of those things are contributing to a sense of anxiety and depression and alienation that I worry about as president. And so, I think we ought to do everything we can to try to restore that spirit of adventure and curiosity and exploration and learning. And I think that’s a real challenge, both domestically and internationally,
### Assistant: Well, let’s talk about domestic politics now. What role does democracy play in our political process?
### Human: A huge role. One of the reasons I ran for office was because I wanted to give young Americans an opportunity to serve their country in a meaningful way. And that includes running for office themselves. And one of the great privileges of holding public office is that you’ve got a chance to hear directly from the American people. And so that’s why I insisted on town halls during the campaign and making sure that we held meetings throughout America, whether it’s Iowa or New Hampshire or Michigan or South Carolina or wherever it happened to be. And what I found was that when you engage with voters, they tell you what they think and what worries them and what concerns them and what hopes they have for their children. And that’s invaluable information because that tells you what you should prioritize. And if you ignore that feedback, if you pretend that you know what people need without listening to them, then you’ll never get anything done.
### Assistant: But what if the majority of voices are wrong?
### Human: Well, then you shouldn’t pass legislation based on what the majority wants. But again, the point is that the majority doesn’t always represent the consensus opinion among Americans. In fact, in many cases, the majority reflects only the loudest minority. If you look back historically, you know, women, minorities, LGBT folks, immigrants, poor people, rural communities—they have often been left behind and neglected by Washington DC. And that’s why politicians have tried to appeal to the largest segment of the electorate instead of trying to reach out to those communities that aren’t represented as well. And that’s a mistake. It’s why we see such stark divides between urban and rural areas. It’s why we see such disparities between blacks and whites in education attainment and wealth accumulation. So, you know, I think that the reason we have so much dysfunction in our political systems is that we haven’t paid enough attention to the voices that aren’t represented in Washington DC.
Now, the good news is that that’s changing. Over the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of grassroots movements that are bringing fresh energy to our politics. Whether it’s Black Lives Matter, or Occupy Wall Street, or #MeToo, or March For Our Lives, these groups are demonstrating that ordinary Americans can bring about real change. And when that happens, we end up having elections where the winner is actually determined by more than half
