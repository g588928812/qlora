### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won?
### Human: Well, let's be honest. He didn’t win; I lost. That’s what happened. And there are all sorts of reasons why that was true. But I will say this, though: it wasn’t because I ran a bad campaign. It wasn’t because we had the wrong message. We knew exactly what we were talking about. We knew how to get our vote out. We built a huge grassroots organization and we won the popular vote by more than three million votes. So I don't buy into this notion that somehow we weren’t tough enough or we should have gone negative earlier. There may be some truth to those things but they don’t explain why somebody who spent twice as much money as us came up short. You know, I mean, so what happened? Well, we knew going into Election Day that there would be a lot of uncertainty around the outcome, right? Because of the nature of the Electoral College system, you’ve got these weird states where if you just have one state go red or blue, then you end up winning. Pennsylvania was a good example of that, Wisconsin another. Michigan even. Minnesota! Right? Which hadn’t voted Republican since like the early ‘80s. And so there was always this sense that if we could just hold onto those states, which we did, then it wouldn’t matter if something crazy happened elsewhere. Well, what ended up happening elsewhere was the Comey letter
### Assistant: The October surprise.
### Human: Exactly. And when that came out late in the campaign, it had such a profound effect on undecided voters that suddenly everything else kind of fell away. And so what I think happened was that there were a whole bunch of people who said they were undecided and then decided to break towards him. Now, whether any of them actually changed their mind on any particular issue remains to be seen, but what seemed clear at the time was that many of them simply felt anxious and uncertain and wanted someone who seemed stronger and tougher and more decisive. And he offered himself as a candidate who could fill those shoes better than anyone else.
### Assistant: How do you respond to that? I mean, maybe you can help me understand. What was the impact of that letter? What was the impact of that? And what does it say about human psychology and political psychology?
### Human: Well, look, I mean, obviously it played a role. And it was really the last piece of ammunition that he needed after a very effective convention and a pretty strong debate performance. After that, there was only one thing left, and that was to convince voters that we were rigging the election. And so he put out this letter saying that there might be new emails coming out and he asked the Justice Department to make sure that these folks didn’t release it. And it turns out that there wasn’t anything there. There was nothing that warranted releasing it and yet millions of Americans saw that as evidence that the fix was in.
### Assistant: So do you blame James Comey for that? Do you blame Hillary Clinton for that? Or is that just a symptom of the times?
### Human: Look, I think both contributed. I mean, obviously Mr. Comey’s decision to break with longstanding practice and send a letter to Congress knowing full well that it would cause havoc with the election was irresponsible and potentially criminal. I mean, it was not an act of heroism. It was not done out of concern for justice or the national interest. He sent it because he thought he could politically benefit from doing so. That alone was probably enough to cost her the race. Then Mrs. Clinton compounded matters by not seeming particularly interested throughout most of the general election debates in explaining her vision for governing and for America. She seemed focused solely on responding to whatever questions she got asked instead of setting forth her own agenda. So between those two factors, plus the fact that she didn’t connect with certain parts of the electorate, particularly working class white men, she couldn’t overcome the forces arrayed against her.
But to your larger point, the idea that someone who’d been elected to the position once before could lose office just because they received fewer votes than their opponent is ludicrous. You’re supposed to lose sometimes. Elections aren’t supposed to be life and death struggles for the survival of the country. They’re supposed to be contests over ideas. And ultimately, the voters decide who gets to lead and who doesn’t. And so it’s hard to take seriously the notion that the results of elections are illegit
### Assistant: Do you think Donald Trump believes that the election was rigged? Does he still believe that the election was rigged?
### Human: I think he’s convinced himself that it was. And I also think that he genuinely thinks that he won the popular vote. And again, that tells you something about what the current state of affairs is in America. If you can persuade yourself that you won a majority of the popular vote when you actually lost by several million votes, that suggests either that you’re delusional or that the country has become so polarized that you feel comfortable telling yourself whatever narrative helps support your worldview regardless of the facts on the ground. And unfortunately, that’s the case.
