### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do people hate? What's it like to be hated? Because that seems to be at the root of much of what we're seeing in our society today.
### Human: I think if we really want to understand why there are so many angry people out there, it’s important to realize how easy it is to get sucked into that anger and hatred. And one reason I wrote this book was because even though it might seem like a lot of us are doing fine these days economically and otherwise, we know that there's still enormous pain and suffering going on around the country. There's still families struggling with unemployment and underemployment. There are kids not getting enough to eat at home. There are young men disproportionately ending up in prison instead of college classrooms. There are communities ravaged by drug addiction and gang violence. There are veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries. So I wanted to write this book partly to try to remind ourselves just how blessed we are compared to most other countries around the world, but also to try to remind ourselves that despite all our problems and challenges, America remains the greatest country on earth precisely because we have this extraordinary capacity to come together and solve big problems.
### Assistant: It's true that we don't always see that side of things. We've had a very rough couple of years. You've talked about it in the book. We saw COVID and its economic impact and the pandemic response and then George Floyd and the subsequent protests. All of those events seem to tear apart our nation. And yet somehow amidst all that, you believe that we can find common ground.
### Human: Well, let me explain why I believe that. Look, when I became president after eight years of Republican rule under George W. Bush, I inherited a pretty dire situation. The economy was struggling. Unemployment was high. The financial system was shaky. Our standing in the world was diminished. And so it wasn't surprising that some Americans felt angry and frustrated. They were hurting. But I refused to blame them. Instead, I asked myself, what can we do to help them? How can we bring folks along who may feel left behind? And over time, I tried to figure out ways to make progress on issues that mattered deeply to ordinary citizens. Whether it was health care, whether it was education, whether it was infrastructure, whether it was manufacturing jobs, whatever it happened to be, I tried to ask, what does this mean for regular folks? Can they get ahead? Can their lives improve? That was my approach. But I didn't take that approach alone. I surrounded myself with smart people whose job it was to tell me what ordinary Americans cared about. To listen to their concerns. Then I tried to work with Congress and others to figure out how to address those concerns. That doesn't guarantee success every single time. Sometimes we fell short. But we did better than anyone thought possible at the beginning. So that's the approach I took throughout my administration. And it's the approach I continue to believe is essential if we're ever
### Assistant: going to tackle our biggest problems. So we can't just talk past each other; we need to actually listen and find solutions together.
### Human: Absolutely. And that's not always easy. I mean, part of what happens during periods of heightened polarization is you lose track of the things that unite us. And what I found in my own life is that although I grew up feeling like I was black first and American second, once I got to Chicago, where I spent a good chunk of my adolescence and early adulthood, I realized that I shared more with white folks than I did with black folks. And that helped me appreciate the richness of diversity within America itself. Even though I'd grown up in Hawaii, which is extraordinarily diverse ethnically and culturally, I hadn't fully appreciated before moving to Chicago that you could walk down any block and hear five different languages spoken. Or that the city reflected so many different ethnicities and cultures. I remember one summer evening, walking through a neighborhood called Hyde Park and realizing that you could turn onto one street and hear Italian opera sung at one house, and then turn another corner and hear salsa music blasting from another apartment complex. In fact, there was such a wide range of music playing that I ended up stopping by a house where someone was practicing gospel music. And they invited me in. And I sang along with them. And I started learning about gospel music. And that experience helped me appreciate how great our country is precisely because we have such tremendous variety within it. I think sometimes we forget that. But I came away from my experiences in Illinois thinking that
### Assistant: One of the best compliments I've received in my life was from Kanye West. He said “Chicago is one of the best cities in the world.”
Yes! I love Chicago. I grew up in Honolulu, Hawaii. It's paradise.
### Human: Oh, it's beautiful!
And now I live in Washington, D.C., which is also a beautiful place. And I'll say something else too that I learned growing up there. When I went off to college, I studied political science and international relations and economics. And I was very focused on trying to become a foreign policy expert. And I quickly discovered that while those subjects were interesting, they weren't nearly as exciting as meeting new people from different backgrounds. They weren't nearly as fun as going to parties and clubs and discovering new artists. And I remember talking to a friend of mine named Craig Robinson. He was the basketball coach at Princeton University. And he reminded me that what made Princeton special was that you couldn't just study abroad in Europe or Africa or Asia. You couldn't just major in International Relations. You had to take courses across the entire curriculum. And that meant that every day you were interacting with somebody you never would have met otherwise. Everyday you were learning something new about yourself. Everyday you were broadening your horizons. Everyday you were becoming a smarter person. And I thought about that. And I decided that the only way I could stay in touch with the world outside my bubble was to keep traveling and exploring and staying open to new ideas. And that helped me appreciate how much richer life is when you're willing to reach beyond what you already know.
You mentioned music earlier. What role did music
### Assistant: play in your life? What role does music play in the lives of people you admire? People you look up to.
Well, I think it plays a huge role. I mean, look, growing up, especially when I was younger, music was sort of my refuge. I listened to a lot of records. And when I was a kid, I played the saxophone. And I liked to sing in the shower. And I loved writing poetry. And I used to read books by Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou and Nikki Giovanni and James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. And so I grew up immersed in literature and music. As I got older, I guess maybe in high school and college, I began listening to rock and roll and hip hop and soul. And so music was always a big part of my life. I still remember the moment I heard Otis Redding singing “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” for the first time. I mean, it blew me away. It was amazing. I mean, just the raw emotion. The power of the voice. Just the passion. It moved me. And I think that's part of what makes music so powerful. It can move us in ways that nothing else can. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why it tends to inspire poets and writers and musicians and actors and directors. And that's why music is often woven into the fabric of films and plays and
### Human: And novels and poems. Yeah, absolutely.
I think music helps us express emotions that words alone cannot capture. And that's why I'm grateful for all the musicians who've inspired me over the years. From Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry and Little Richard and Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles to Bruce Springsteen and Public Enemy and Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye and Beyoncé and Jay Z and Kendrick Lamar and Cardi B and Drake and Childish Gambino and Eminem and Lil Wayne and Travis Scott and Ariana Grande and Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift. Musicians of all kinds.
Oh, yeah. I love music. I've been listening to a bunch of different stuff lately.
That's cool. What kind?
Oh, everything. Everything from classical to jazz to folk to funk to R&B.
