### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won? You know that better than anybody else. I'm asking you because there are many answers to this question.
### Human: That's true. And there's no simple answer. But I can tell you why it happened. It happened because there were some people out there who felt left behind. And we had seen a lot of dislocation over the course of the last several decades. Globalization and technological changes have put enormous strains on communities that have historically depended upon either large employers or government or both for good jobs at decent wages. So what happens then is there's a certain kind of cultural and political backlash against what feels like an ever more complex world in which everybody is trying to figure things out and we all feel like we don't really understand how it works anymore. What we see instead is we start seeing a lot of finger pointing and a whole bunch of scapegoats. And when somebody comes along and says I've got a solution to all these problems, whether they're Muslims or Mexicans or the industrial heartland, suddenly folks say, “that sounds pretty reasonable.” And so those were the forces that played themselves out during the campaign. Now, having said that, if you look back at what was going on even before the election, if you look back at what was going on in the Republican primary process, where you had the first major party presidential candidate basically running as the nominee who didn’t win any primaries and caucuses, but still got himself the nomination. If you look at the general election itself, it wasn't just about the candidates
### Assistant: No, but the question is why did the candidate who lost the popular vote get elected?
### Human: Right, right, but let me keep going. Because ultimately, we ended up with the Electoral College, not the popular vote, deciding the outcome. And that was due to a combination of factors. One was the fact that Mr. Trump spent most of his time campaigning in the small number of states that mattered electorally, rather than trying to go state by state around the country, as most campaigns try to do. Secondly, there was a huge gender gap and a racial gap in terms of who voted for him. And thirdly, there were enough voters out there who were willing to vote for someone who was clearly not qualified for the job because they thought he would shake things up. They weren't necessarily sure exactly what it was they wanted, but they knew something needed to be done differently.
### Assistant: Yeah, I mean, there's also a lot of evidence showing that there's a big difference between how men and women vote and how different races vote. So there's very well could have been a lot of different reasons why Clinton lost and Trump won, maybe none of them had anything to do with Russia or WikiLeaks or Comey or any of those kinds of things. Maybe it had everything to do with something else entirely. We don't know. But there's definitely room to explore that and perhaps to come up with solutions for those issues, because it seems like that's part of our system, too. And maybe you can help us fix that.
### Human: Well, one of the things that you mentioned earlier is the role of technology, and you may recall that I actually talked about this issue early on when I came into office. In particular, I remember visiting Intel headquarters shortly after taking office, and their CEO, Paul Otellini, gave me this tour of their facilities. And it turns out they were doing a lot of work around using computer chips that can do facial recognition in order to track people inside buildings and make sure that nobody gets into sensitive areas without proper authorization. And he asked me, he says, “what should we do?” Should we use this technology? Obviously, we need to secure our nation and make sure that we protect classified information and prevent espionage. But he pointed out that this same technology could be used to violate Americans’ civil liberties. And he specifically referenced Black Lives Matter protests where somebody might want to identify who’s in attendance and then somehow intimidate or harass them afterwards. He said, “I want your advice,” meaning he wants the president’s advice. And so I told him, yes, this is a legitimate concern. And I went on to talk about other ways in which technology is already affecting our lives and the potential pitfalls associated with it. But I also suggested that he and his company take some leadership in making sure that the algorithms that power these systems are designed in such a way that they respect privacy and constitutional rights and don't end up being used for nefarious purposes
### Assistant: And that's exactly what I'd love to hear you talk about today, because it seems like a lot of these technologies that are now being used by companies are unchecked by anyone. There's no regulations whatsoever. So Facebook and Google and Twitter and others are essentially creating their own sets of rules without any input from the public or lawmakers. Do you see any value to that or not?
### Human: I guess it depends on the specific situation. I think if you’re talking about algorithmic decisionmaking by private sector companies, I think there needs to be a degree of transparency. If you’re looking at somebody’s credit score and it ends up determining whether they qualify for a loan, that should probably be based on publicly available data. Otherwise there could potentially be discriminatory impacts. The same thing goes if somebody uses an algorithm to decide who to hire or who to give preferential treatment to or what to show somebody on YouTube or whatever. But again, I think there’ll always be some situations where you need to keep some stuff proprietary.
### Assistant: So you agree that there's a problem here with Big Tech?
Yes, I think there are problems. And I think there are some real questions about whether or not there ought to be new regulation coming down the pike.
### Human: As far as whether or not we ought to regulate the Internet generally, I tend to be somewhat skeptical. And the reason is because there are lots of industries that are heavily regulated and yet seem to function quite well. I'm thinking of banking and financial services in particular. I mean, there are laws on the books that govern how banks do business with consumers and how much interest they pay on various accounts. Those laws are often enforced through the regulatory agencies. Then you have another layer of regulation from the federal level that requires banks to follow certain anti-money laundering protocols or sanctions compliance protocols. And finally, you have consumer protection legislation at the state and local levels. Is that perfect? Absolutely not. I mean, you still have bank failures from time to time. But overall, the system seems to work pretty well. So while I think there are some benefits to greater regulation, especially when it comes to financial institutions that are deemed “too big to fail” because that poses systemic risk to the entire economy, I'm not convinced that that same approach will lead to improvements when it comes to tech platforms.
