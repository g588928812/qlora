### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think you won the Nobel Peace Prize? And what did winning that prize mean to you personally?
### Human: Well, thanks so much for having me back. It's always good to be with you. The short answer is I don’t really know why they gave it to me. They didn’t give it to me because of anything particularly I had done at the time other than the fact that I was the president of the United States. And maybe there were some residual feelings about the end of the Cold War. But if you ask me now, knowing how tumultuous those early years were and knowing where we are today, would I have done anything differently? No, I wouldn’t. Because I fundamentally believe that when you look around this world, even though there are going to be conflicts between countries and people sometimes will make mistakes and pursue objectives that may turn out not to be in their interest, ultimately what human beings want more than anything else is peace; is security; is the chance for their kids to get educated; to live up to their God-given potential. Those aspirations are universal. That's why when you see refugees pouring out of Syria right now, that's why you see people risking their lives trying to leave Venezuela, no matter how imperfectly folks like us try to respond to these problems, we can only do so much. Ultimately, what we need is for people to feel confident that they've got a stake in the political process within their own country and to be able to chart their own course. Sometimes that means you're going
### Assistant: to have to fight against forces that try to prevent that kind of progress.
### Human: Exactly. Sometimes it means you're going to be fighting against entrenched interests. Sometimes it means you're going to be fighting against people whose religion or ethnic identity makes them fearful of what your agenda might be. Or sometimes it just means you're going to have to overcome the legacy of corruption and mismanagement and bad habits that may stretch back decades. But I firmly believe that if we give ourselves enough time and we stay true to our values, which includes making sure that everybody feels like they’ve got a say in how things work, then eventually we’ll see positive results. And that's why when I travel around the globe today, I continue to say that America is not the problem; we're part of the solution. We may not have all the answers, but we do have a lot of experience in dealing with big problems and figuring out ways to move forward. So if nothing else, the prize should embolden me and others to redouble our efforts in pursuit of those goals that ultimately are in everyone’s interest.
I also think that if you look back over the sweep of history, whether it’s somebody who influenced global affairs through military action, someone who tried to bring peace through negotiation, or an artist who tried to express hope and possibility through song or some combination of all three, these are actually pretty rare distinctions. And while none of us should ever take these honors for granted, it does mean something that after four
### Assistant: presidents before me have received this award, including my fellow Texan, Lyndon Johnson, and that you’re following in that tradition.
### Human: Yes. And I think it also says something about the arc of the international system and American foreign policy since World War II that although we haven’t always gotten everything right, we’ve made steady progress. You go from World War II to the Marshall Plan to the Berlin Airlift to the civil rights movement, to getting rid of Apartheid in South Africa, and then moving toward nuclear disarmament in the 80s, and then opening China in the 90s, and now you've got a rising India, and most recently, you've got a democratic Pakistan. So the notion that somehow America doesn’t play any role internationally anymore isn’t borne out by the facts. I think it’s fair to say that the world looks different than it did during the Cold War, and yet we still play such an important role in shaping events. And I hope that continues.
### Assistant: So one thing you mentioned that I think is often forgotten is you said that America is not the problem. America is part of the solution. What do you think is the biggest challenge facing humanity today?
### Human: I guess I would divide it into two parts. One is the big questions that we face as a planet. How do we deal with climate change? How do we ensure that every child gets the education that they deserve? How do we promote greater tolerance and understanding among peoples and faiths and cultures? These are huge challenges. And I certainly wish I could wave a wand and solve all of them overnight. But we have made real progress despite enormous odds. Think about it. Just think about the last century. The vast majority of the world’s population lived under autocratic rule until the middle of the 20th century. Then you fast forward to today, and you've seen an extraordinary transformation. Not everybody is happy with that transformation, obviously, and we shouldn’t kid ourselves that it’s going to happen everywhere overnight. But when you compare where we are to where we were, I am optimistic.
The second piece of the puzzle is what happens within particular countries. Obviously, you look around the world and you’ll see some places where there are ongoing conflicts and humanitarian disasters. And it is heartbreaking to watch innocent men, women, children caught in the crossfire. When I was in Aleppo, for example, and saw families streaming out of their homes and heading down to the riverbank hoping that they might find some safety downstream, it was gut-wrenching. And yet we cannot wish away the fact that there are competing grievances inside of
### Assistant: Syria and competing ideas and ideologies and groups of people that are interested in using violence to impose their ideology onto the rest of the population.
### Human: Absolutely. And unfortunately, social media and modern communications technology both help fan the flames and also allow for people to target vulnerable populations and carry out terrible acts. In some cases, it’s the direct result of terrorist organizations seeking to achieve maximum impact. In other cases, it’s people who are basically settling scores with imagined slights dating back to long ago. So we’re going to have to approach each situation individually. But ultimately, my view remains that we can promote stability without resorting to military intervention whenever possible, provided that we maintain strong coalitions, provide adequate support on the ground, and use the full range of our diplomatic tools. And we may occasionally stumble along the way, but hopefully we never again engage in Iraq-style or Afghanistan-style deployments that put large numbers of U.S. service members at great risk without a clear strategy for what comes next.
Let me just give you another specific example. Libya was another place where there had been a dictator who left power. There were multiple armed militias on the ground instead of a central government. And it ended up getting very complicated and messy, and it destabilized its neighbor, Mali. And so what I argued at the time was, let’s avoid doing something similar in Syria. Unfortunately, the world proved me wrong. Now, we have dealt with spillover effects in many other places. For example, Boko Haram in Nigeria has proven more resilient than we anticipated based on
