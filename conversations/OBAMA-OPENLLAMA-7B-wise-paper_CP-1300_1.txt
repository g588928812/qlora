### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected?
### Human: I'm tempted to give you a wonkish response that says there were a lot of structural factors involved. The economy had not performed well enough during his campaign so people didn't feel it was working for them. There were some foreign policy challenges that they felt like we weren't handling well. There were issues around race and immigration and all these things that we could go into great detail about. But if I just boil it down to what happened, which is really at its core, there were a whole bunch of folks who for years had been told by their political leaders that everything was fine, the system works, we can trust our institutions, and then suddenly all those same people are outraged because somebody they don’t particularly like got elected president. And they're not sure whether it's because of Russian interference, or whether it's because the media is too negative towards him, but they’ve lost faith in their government. They feel ignored. and they feel like their values are under attack. And the only way they know how to express their frustration is through this guy who seems to be saying whatever he thinks regardless of what other people might say. Even though many of those ideas might seem crazy to most Americans, they somehow feel like it’s their last shot to get somebody who will listen. And so that's why he was elected. That's probably the best answer I have right now.
### Assistant: What do you think is the cause of that loss of faith in government and in society generally? Is it just that it's cyclical? Is it something about the current time period where people are having less trust than before? Or is there more fundamental problems underneath that you sense?
### Human: No, I mean, I think it’s both. It’s both. You know, I grew up in Chicago when Mayor Daley basically said “we run this city and everybody else better learn their place.” And nobody dared challenge that for decades until Rahm Emanuel left office and a new crop of young mayors came in. And one of them said “I want to hear your voice” and “you need to come to City Hall.” Because people had gotten used to thinking that “well, this is the way we're supposed to do things,” even though they didn’t see any results for it. So they had become cynical, and rightly so. On the national level, we haven’t seen much evidence of people getting stuff done except when somebody like Lyndon Johnson comes along and passes a major piece of legislation. Now, I understand that there are practical reasons why that hasn't happened recently. We still live in a country where we have gerrymandered districts and the filibuster means that you need 60 votes to pass anything instead of 50 plus one. So, you know, we have structural barriers to progress, but that doesn’t mean that ordinary citizens aren't frustrated with what they see happening around them. And so I do think it is partly a reaction to the way that people are feeling.
### Assistant: So let me ask another big picture thing. How does it happen that such an intelligent person like yourself became the leader of the free world and yet so few others are able to achieve that? How does it happen that such a high percentage of people are willing to elect someone who is clearly not qualified?
### Human: Well, I guess I would begin by saying that anybody who's ever accomplished anything worth accomplishing knows that nothing happens unless you work hard to make it happen. And sometimes you succeed despite obstacles, sometimes you fail despite good intentions.
But the notion that somebody just gets to a position of power and then magically things get done is simply wrong. I mean, look, I ran for public office because I thought I could make a difference. I wasn't born into money; I wasn't born into privilege; I didn't start off with advantages that other people did. I started out as a community organizer and I worked my way up through local and state politics because I believed that if we fixed our broken political process, that it wouldn't matter who got elected. America had enormous potential and I wanted to help realize that potential. But if you look back over the course of my career, I always faced headwinds. Whether it was people saying “he's not black enough,” or “he's too black,” or “nobody from Chicago should be running for President,” or “Chicagoans shouldn't care about what goes on in Springfield,” or “no woman should be allowed to run for president,” or “she needs to smile more.” You name it, I heard it. And every time I overcame that obstacle, I was able to move forward. And part of the reason that I was able to do that is because I surrounded
### Assistant: Self-doubt?
Human: myself with people who I trusted, who shared similar values. And then I also learned that when push came to shove, most Americans weren't going to judge me based on the color of my skin or where I grew up or what I wore on my face. They were looking for somebody who could deliver real solutions to their problems. And once I figured out how to connect with people on those terms, I actually was pretty successful.
So I guess the point that I would make is that anyone who wants to accomplish something important knows that they'll face obstacles. They know that they're going to have to work hard. They know that they can't take no for an answer. They know that if they want to get somewhere, they can't just stand still. They have to keep moving forward. But if you do that, you can get a lot done.
Now, none of us are perfect. Nobody's gonna agree with everything that I did while I was in office. Somebody asked me once whether I could have done anything differently and honestly, after reflecting on what I've done, I genuinely believe that the changes that we were able to make were ones that moved the ball forward and I hope future generations are able to build upon them.
### Human: So you mentioned earlier that you’ve known me since I was in college and maybe we met briefly then, although I’m pretty sure we didn’t meet then. I remember meeting you at least once later on. But the funny thing about knowing people for a long time is that it’s easy to forget how smart they are or how interesting they are or what they went through. Sometimes you just think of them as this friend of yours who’s doing their own thing. So I’m curious what you’ve learned about me over the years.
### Assistant: Okay, I’m definitely interested in learning about you too. I mean, we’ve obviously followed each other’s life journey and you’ve become one of the most consequential human beings in recent times and I’ve watched that entire evolution unfolding. But yeah, what’s changed in you from being a young man in college to a man who is now almost eight years into his retirement?
### Human: Oh wow. Well, that’s a long time ago, isn’t it? Honestly, I think the biggest change for me was becoming a parent. When I was younger, I never imagined that someday I would end up having three daughters. And when Malia was born, that experience fundamentally altered the arc of my life. Because suddenly I realized what it meant to raise children who would grow up in a different world than the one I grew up in. I began to appreciate just how much influence I would have as an older sibling raising kids who were younger than me. And I also knew that as long as I stayed true to my values and tried to do what I believed was right, hopefully I’d set a positive example for them.
