### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump was elected president? I ask this because it seems so bizarre to me that someone like him could be elected president of the United States. And yet he's been elected twice. So what happened? What does that say about us as Americans?
### Human: Well, let's just start at the beginning. It says that we live in a very polarized society. There are two Americas now. One America is a majority America, which is basically the country that I grew up in, where people look more alike than they differ. They may disagree on some issues, but there’s still a commonality there. But then there's another America that’s become much more fragmented. There's a lot of folks who feel left behind economically. And if you go back and listen to the campaign rhetoric over the past few decades, you can see the trend lines. In fact, one of the things that I said when I was running was that we’re going through a fundamental realignment in our politics. That the Republicans used to be a party of Lincoln; they were the party of businessmen. The Democrats used to be the party of working men. Now the Republican Party has gotten much more dominated by the right wing populist tendencies and the Tea Party types. And meanwhile, the Democratic Party has moved toward more of the center. Now, that’s not entirely accurate. Hillary Clinton ran as a moderate Democrat, but she didn’t run against Bernie Sanders. She ran against Donald Trump, who did appeal to populism on both sides. He appealed to left wing populists and right wing populists, and she wasn’t able to counteract that message effectively enough. So we saw the same thing in Great Britain
### Assistant: With Brexit. Yes.
With Brexit, where the Leave vote won. People wanted to leave Europe because they felt that Brussels had too many regulations and that the bureaucracy was taking their jobs away. So I would argue that what we've seen in England and what we've seen in France, which just elected a far right candidate, Marine Le Pen, and we saw in Germany, where Angela Merkel lost her majority in parliament, and in Hungary, which has turned into a dictatorship under Viktor Orban, all these trends are consistent with what we’re seeing in the United States. And again, this isn’t a partisan issue. Republicans have done this as well. Think about Richard Nixon, who was the last Republican president who ran on an anti-elite platform. Ronald Reagan appealed to blue collar workers. George W Bush appealed to evangelicals. Even though Bill Clinton might seem like the epitome of a centrist Democrat, remember he got elected in 1992 campaigning against welfare queens and tax cuts and NAFTA, those were all populist themes. So populism is not necessarily a conservative phenomenon. It certainly appeals to the base of both parties.
### Human: Right. You mentioned Brexit. And I think there's an important difference between the UK and US that maybe explains why Brexit was successful in the UK but not in the US. For example, in the UK, immigration was a big issue. Immigration is something that has always been a political issue in the US but it's never been as divisive as it is today. When I was growing up, immigrants were welcomed. We benefited tremendously from immigration, legal and illegal, and we still benefit from it today. Immigrants tend to be hardworking people. They don't take government benefits. They work, they pay taxes, and they contribute enormously to the economy. So there's a cultural affinity there. Whereas in Europe, immigrants come mostly from Muslim countries, and they're perceived as threats to Western culture and security. That’s how Trump portrayed them during the election. So immigration has become more salient in the UK than it ever was before. That was part of the reason for Brexit. Immigration wasn't the only factor but it played a role in pushing the British towards leaving the EU. In contrast, immigrants are largely welcomed here. The vast majority of them are law abiding citizens. They’re working hard. They’re paying taxes. They’re contributing to the economy. They’re raising families. And even the ones who aren’t doing those things are often victims themselves. They came here fleeing persecution. They came here fleeing
### Assistant: War zones. Right.
Warzones, exactly. And they want nothing more than to find peace, to find safety, to provide a better life for their children, et cetera. So immigration hasn’t become a big deal in the US because we haven’t had a large influx of immigrants coming across the border, although we should be concerned about that. Most immigrants are arriving legally. So immigration is less salient in the US than it is elsewhere in the world. Another distinction is that the US has always been an immigrant nation. Our ancestors arrived here illegally, and we became a melting pot of different cultures. We absorbed other peoples and integrated them into our society. Unlike Europe, we didn't create national boundaries based on ethnicity, language, religion, etc., etc. The United States is the greatest experiment in human history. It's the most diverse nation on earth. So we've had a long tradition of integrating foreigners into our country. So it doesn't surprise me that we would continue to absorb newcomers, despite concerns about terrorism and crime. Because we know that integration works, and that immigrants contribute immensely to our economy. And the fact that we have a strong tradition of welcoming immigrants suggests that our openness will endure.
Immigration is also a nonpartisan issue. Although Republicans tend to oppose immigration, especially undocumented immigration, Democrats support it. So that helps explain why Hillary Clinton, who is generally viewed as a moderate Democrat,
### Human: No, no, no, she ran on open borders.
### Assistant: Open borders? She ran on open borders? No, no, no. I'm saying she supported immigration.
### Human: Yeah, but she was running against Donald Trump. So she couldn't really embrace any of those positions.
Yeah, I guess I meant like liberal immigration. So you can't separate immigration from the broader issue of globalization. Globalization means trade and migration, and that's a bipartisan issue.
So why did Donald Trump win the election? First of all, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Second, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Third, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Fourth, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Fifth, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Sixth, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Seventh, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Eighth, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Ninth, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Tenth, he ran against Hillary Clinton, whom the vast majority of voters considered to be untrustworthy. Eleventh,
### Assistant: So he tapped into populist sentiment that existed among voters across the board.
That was the point I was making.
It goes beyond just Democrats. He tapped into the populist sentiments of Democrats and Republicans alike.
### Human: So you think that's true?
