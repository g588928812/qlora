### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did America vote for Donald Trump?
### Human: Well, I'm not sure that there was one singular reason. And it’s important to remember that when we talk about the election results, it wasn’t just a matter of one person getting more votes than another. It was also about which party won control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. But what we saw were a lot of disgruntled Americans who felt left behind by globalization and automation and a host of other trends. Some of these folks had voted for Barack but then flipped over to support Mr. Trump. They felt like they had legitimate gripes about their circumstances. We also have to recognize though that some people voted for Mr. Trump because even if they didn’t necessarily believe all of the things he said, they still felt that his bombast might shake up the system in ways that would benefit them. And so there really isn’t any single answer why people voted for him.
### Assistant: So are you saying this kind of analysis suggests that the American political process is deeply broken?
### Human: Oh, absolutely. I mean, there are millions of Americans who don’t feel like either party speaks to their interests right now. There are lots of people who feel alienated from both parties. A big chunk of the country simply feels ignored and written off by the powers that be. Now, part of the reason that’s happening is because our political system tends to be quite polarized, and that makes it harder for us to get anything done. It means that we can’t pass new laws that would actually help working families. But it’s also true that politicians need to do a better job listening to voters and trying to understand where they’re coming from instead of thinking only about how to win elections. If we want to make progress as a nation, we need to find ways to come together rather than constantly fighting against each other.
### Assistant: What are some examples of good policies that could be put forward that would address many of those issues that would help those forgotten Americans?
### Human: Well, let me give you one example that I think would go a long way towards helping a lot of people out there. Right now, we have this crazy tax code that gives huge breaks to wealthy individuals and corporations while making life much more difficult for ordinary workers. For example, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that got passed under the Trump administration, someone like me who’s pretty well-off is paying less in taxes than ever before. Meanwhile, middle class families are struggling to pay their bills and it’s become increasingly difficult to afford childcare or send kids to college. I know there are a lot of people who are gonna say “well, maybe it shouldn’t be this way.” Maybe we should have a fairer tax system that doesn’t reward millionaires and billionaires at the expense of everyone else. And I agree with that! That’s exactly the kind of thing that we need to do. But the fact is, there are a lot of entrenched interests who don’t want to see us take action on these kinds of issues because it would cost them money.
So unless something dramatic happens, like some sort of popular uprising or a major shift in power at the national level, we’re probably not going to see any real changes to our tax code anytime soon. However, there is one thing that we could do immediately that would definitely make a difference for working families: increase the minimum wage. In most states, the minimum
### Assistant: In the U.S., yeah.
### Human: Yeah. The federal minimum wage hasn’t changed since 2009 and it’s time for that to finally happen. Most economists will tell you that raising the minimum wage is not only good for the workers who get a raise; it helps businesses too because they’ll end up having fewer employees on public assistance such as food stamps or Medicaid. Plus, research shows that when workers earn more money overall, they tend to spend more of it too which leads to more economic growth across the board. So whether you care about social justice or business owners or just basic math, increasing the minimum wage seems like a no brainer these days.
Now, I know there are some people out there who say “Well, maybe we shouldn’t bother doing anything about the minimum wage because it wouldn’t really make much of a dent in these problems anyway.” But that argument ignores one very simple fact: Every time we elect leaders who are willing to stand up for working people like myself who want a fair shot in life without having to worry about falling into poverty due to unscrupulous employers exploiting their labor then yes we WILL MAKE A DENT IN THESE PROBLEMS. Because if we can guarantee that every hardworking American has access to affordable health insurance coverage then suddenly people aren’t forced into bankruptcy after getting sick anymore (which often leads them into deeper financial trouble) AND businesses don’t have to foot the bill for providing expensive treatments which means they might
### Assistant: That’s the American way. I love it. But there’s so many people that don’t seem to appreciate this. One is the leaders themselves don’t always live up to their promises. And secondly, they’re sometimes not aware of the full picture. So for example, there’s a lot of talk about “free” stuff,” which sounds nice until you realize that somebody’s gotta pay for it. How do we convince people of that?
### Human: Well, I think you have to frame your arguments in terms of what’s best for working people rather than what’s best for special interest groups or whoever else may be opposed to your ideas. You have to show that these reforms will actually create jobs and grow the economy while still leaving plenty of room for people to keep as much of their own earnings as possible. And ultimately, it comes down to values – do we value fairness above everything else? Or do we prefer a system where a few powerful people get everything they want while most others have nothing left to lose except maybe their freedom?
