### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think there's so much hate in America? Hate against immigrants, hate against people of color, hate against women, hate against LGBTQ community, etc. Why does America seem so divided? Is it because we live in such an interesting time where social media plays such a big role? Or is there something deeper at play that goes back centuries, maybe millennia even?
### Human: Well, let me just say this about the hate thing. It's easy to be cynical when you see the way that our political discourse can descend into name calling and into vitriol. And I understand why people are tempted to say “oh man, look at how bad things are.” But I actually believe that Americans still have more in common than divides us. And one of the reasons that's true is that despite all the noise and despite all the divisive rhetoric, we know what makes America great. We know what it means to live up to our founding principles. And that's not always obvious in public life right now. There’s so many loud voices that make it hard to hear some of those core values that we share. But if you spend enough time with folks around the country, whether they voted for me or somebody else, you realize that most of them want their kids to get a good education; they want everybody to be treated fairly under the law; they want to feel safe in their communities. They don't want their house to burn down while they're asleep; they don't want to worry about the price of gas going up every week; they want to make sure that they've got good jobs with decent paychecks; they want to be able to retire with dignity. Most Americans agree that if you work hard, you should be rewarded. That you shouldn't go bankrupt if your child gets sick. They want
### Assistant: Somebody to care about them. Yeah.
### Human: Someone to care about them. They want someone who cares about these basic issues. Even though it may sound cliché, there really are plenty of things that unite us across party lines and across geography. Now, that doesn't mean that every single person agrees with everything that I believe in or that I believe in. Sometimes I find myself having debates with Republicans on taxes or immigration policy. But the truth is that even during elections where the results are close, there are usually more areas where Democrats and Republicans agree on policy than disagree. So the problem isn't that there aren't any areas where we agree. The problem is that sometimes people are too willing to give up on each other, too quick to assume that somebody disagrees because of race or religion or gender identity. And once you assume that somebody disagrees with you because of those categories, then suddenly you can justify treating them differently. And then over time, you start seeing differences between the parties not as disagreements over specific issues but as fundamental conflicts between two groups based on different identities. And once that happens, then we get stuck and we can't break through. Because when you've got two groups fighting each other instead of working together toward a shared goal, then you end up getting gridlock and partisan bickering. And frankly, that's not healthy for democracy.
### Assistant: One of the challenges, as you mentioned, is when you talk about racism and prejudice against various minorities in America today. There is a lot of disagreement among minorities themselves about how much racism exists today and what to do about it. How do you navigate that?
### Human: First of all, I would say that racism remains a real problem in our society. Obviously, I didn't experience it as president. I haven't experienced it since leaving office. But it certainly existed before I became president. My hope is that as we move forward, it will continue to diminish. And part of that depends upon each generation taking responsibility to make sure that we leave behind a better world than we inherited. But also, part of it depends upon people making sure that everyone feels like they belong, regardless of their background. In order to solve problems, we need everybody at the table. We need people with diverse experiences coming up with solutions. If you look at some of the best ideas out there, oftentimes they come from unexpected places. A few years ago, I was watching a basketball game and a guy named Steve Kerr was coaching the Golden State Warriors. He had this great philosophy called the “triangle offense,” which he developed as a player and coach in college basketball. Nobody used that kind of offensive strategy in professional basketball until he came along. Turns out it worked pretty well for him and his team. And now it's become standard practice throughout the league. So that's a great example of somebody who had the right idea at the right time, regardless of his background.
### Assistant: But when it comes to racism and discrimination against minorities, What advice do you have for leaders and everyday citizens alike? How do you deal with that? Do you try to ignore it? Do you try to confront it directly? Are there tools you use? Maybe you could tell a story or two about times when you encountered racism personally, or racism in general, and how you dealt with it.
### Human: Sure, I'll tell you one story. When I ran for president in 2008, I remember going to a town hall meeting somewhere in Iowa, and somebody asked me this question. They said, “What do you plan to do about white farmers in Africa?” And I paused for a second, trying to figure out exactly what they were talking about. Then I realized that they meant black South Africans who were losing their farms. Because I had spent quite a bit of time visiting South Africa after apartheid ended. I knew that land redistribution wasn't necessarily going to help the situation. I mean, the fact that you had white families owning large amounts of land that hadn't been farmed for generations was probably contributing to poverty and inequality. But I also recognized that you couldn't ignore the historic injustice of how that wealth had been accumulated in the first place. And I decided that rather than criticizing the government for its approach to land reform, I wanted to offer constructive alternatives. That way, I hoped that I could demonstrate to both sides that I understood their concerns. And ultimately, I did win that election. And I remember telling Nelson Mandela afterwards, who was very gracious, that although I differed with him on certain approaches, I admired him for acknowledging the mistakes of the past and trying to address them constructively. That's a lesson that applies to lots of situations. Wherever you see injustice, wherever you see discrimination, whatever wrongs
### Assistant: Were you surprised by the level of vitriolic hatred directed towards you as a Black man, especially during the primary season?
### Human: Not surprisingly, I was surprised at the intensity. I mean, obviously there was a fair amount of criticism directed at me before I became president, but I was never expecting to face the same level of hostility that I saw during the primaries. After all, I'd only been governor of Illinois for four years. And then I won a Senate seat from a state that hasn't elected a Democrat statewide since the 1960s. And yet somehow I managed to beat Hillary Clinton in Iowa. And the next day, she was on the cover of Time magazine. So clearly the expectation was that I was supposed to lose, and it took me by surprise that anyone thought otherwise.
But then once I started running against Senator McCain and Governor Romney, things got worse. You know, you expect opposition candidates to attack you and try to paint you negatively, but when they resort to personal insults and outright lies, that's something else entirely. That's when you begin to wonder whether these are people who really respect the democratic process.
