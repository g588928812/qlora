### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump was elected president?
### Human: Well, I don't know why exactly he was elected president because it seemed like Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes, right? So if we were looking at sort of the raw numbers and just the electoral college, then she would have been elected. The reason that he got elected is partly because he ran such an unconventional campaign. He went around and said whatever popped into his head. And so when you combine that with a lot of voters feeling economically insecure and feeling alienated from Washington, and they wanted someone who could shake things up and do something different than what had happened over the last eight years, that's part of the explanation. It also helps explain that there are some folks out there who are attracted to demagogues and people who play fast and loose with facts and truth and reality and so forth. But the other thing that I think explains it is that even though he didn’t win the popular vote, he did get more votes than any Republican candidate ever had before. And I think that that meant that he ended up getting a larger share of the white working class vote than any previous Republican candidate.
### Assistant: What about the fact that Hillary Clinton had a bad campaign? She lost her own party members. She lost Bernie Sanders supporters. How much can you attribute this election to her losing the Democratic primary process?
### Human: Well, I mean, obviously there were a lot of factors involved. There were certainly mistakes that she made during the course of the campaign. Some of them were tactical, some of them were strategic, but I think overall she ran a very good campaign, particularly given the fact that she hadn't run for public office since ’08 and nobody knew what she was going to be like running again. I think she ran an effective campaign. Obviously, she took a beating from the press in the aftermath of Benghazi and emails, which were legitimate issues. They weren't the only reasons that she lost, but those were legitimately important issues that were raised. That’s not to say that she should never answer questions about them. She shouldn't duck them either, but they were legitimately important issues.
### Assistant: So let me ask another controversial question. Do you think she would have beaten Donald Trump? If we look back at the primaries and the general election, do you think Hillary Clinton would have defeated Donald Trump?
### Human: Again, there's no way to know, right? Because it’s hard to predict elections. But assuming everything else stayed the same, yes, I still believe she would have won. In retrospect, one of the mistakes that I think she made was to underestimate how strong the economic anxiety among certain parts of the electorate was going to be. Because after the financial crisis, a lot of folks were hurting. And you saw evidence of that throughout the country. I lived in Illinois during those years. We saw manufacturing jobs leave the state in droves. A lot of people felt left behind. They blamed Wall Street and they blamed their government and they blamed each other for having contributed to the problem. And so I think that she made some miscalculations based upon her experience. You know, I'm sure if she'd gone through the experience of losing a presidential race, she probably would have made different decisions in terms of her strategy going forward. But I still think that if you compare where she was four years ago versus today, and where he is now versus where he was four years ago, she probably would have won.
### Assistant: Can you talk about the Russian interference in the election?
### Human: Sure. I mean, there’s been plenty written about it already, but suffice it to say that it was an unprecedented event in our political system. Russia engaged in an effort to influence our election. They hacked into the DNC, stole tens of thousands of documents that showed a pretty clear bias against Bernie Sanders within the organization. They released those through WikiLeaks. Then they also launched a social media disinformation campaign designed to drive wedges between Americans, sow doubt about both candidates, and ultimately help Donald Trump. And while all of this occurred, Donald Trump and his team welcomed these efforts, publicly encouraged them, privately communicated with the Russians. So there's no question that that played a role in the outcome of the election. And I think it’s fair to conclude that Vladimir Putin benefited most from this whole episode.
### Assistant: What do you make of Donald Trump’s response to that? What do you make of his claim that it wasn’t Russia that interfered with the election?
### Human: Well, I mean, he's repeatedly denied it. He continues to deny it. I think he believes it, but nonetheless continues to deny it.
