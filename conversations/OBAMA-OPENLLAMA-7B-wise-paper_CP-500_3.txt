### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we need heroes? And what does it mean to be a hero?
### Human: Well, I think there are many different kinds of heroes, and I think we all have our favorites. And I've certainly got some favorite athletes and musicians that I admire. But I do think it’s important for us to recognize that in any given moment, we may not see someone who meets every one of those criteria. We may see people whose actions have a ripple effect on their community, even if they don’t necessarily make headline news. And so for example, when I was growing up, the civil rights movement inspired a lot of young activists in Chicago like Jesse Jackson and Harold Washington and others. And they were very much involved in the fight against segregation, but they didn’t become national figures. They weren’t household names. They weren’t celebrities. But their work had a real impact on their communities. So I do think that there are times where the role of heroes becomes less about making the headlines than it does about inspiring other folks.
### Assistant: Can you talk about that ripple effect? How can one person inspire others? What makes them inspirational? Because sometimes they may be quiet, they may be humble.
### Human: Well, it depends upon how they conduct themselves. You know, I think there are times where somebody may act heroically without getting the recognition they deserve. There may be occasions where somebody doesn’t get the recognition they deserve because they’re too modest or they don’t want the spotlight. Or maybe they just prefer to quietly do their work. That's great. That's fine. But at least they're doing something positive and constructive. And hopefully, it inspires others to follow suit.
Now, I will say this, though: I am reminded of something Nelson Mandela once said about heroes. He said, “A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom.” And so when we look at the kind of heroes that I mentioned earlier — whether it's Jackie Robinson or Rosa Parks or Dr. King — these individuals understood the power of their freedom and used it to try to improve the lives of their fellow citizens. And so when we think about what constitutes a true hero, I think it's somebody who uses their freedom responsibly.
I'm also reminded of something Gandhi once said about heroes. He said, “The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.” And so often, when we think about heroes, they’re celebrated for standing up against injustice. And while that's admirable, sometimes it sends the message that you’ve got to go out and fight your battles yourself. And
### Assistant: If we could take the opposite approach and instead celebrate the heroes that help you feel good, the ones that bring joy into your life.
### Human: Absolutely. One of the things that we know about human beings is we tend to respond most strongly to losses than we do to gains. So if you ask anybody, “What do you remember more clearly?” The answer is usually the time you lost something rather than the time you gained something. And so if we want to encourage people to persevere and continue to contribute positively to society, then we should probably highlight the examples of people who overcame adversity and achieved success despite difficult odds. It might be easier to recall those stories than it would be to recall stories about someone who simply maintained steady progress over decades of service.
And so I'll give you an example. When I was governor of Illinois, one of my staffers was a woman named Dawn Clark Netsch. She was an amazing lawyer, but she struggled with severe dyslexia throughout her career. And yet she went on to become the longest serving female member of the state legislature. And I remember talking to her years ago and asking her why she stayed involved in public affairs even after she was elected to office. Her response was simple: “Because I couldn’t imagine a world where I wasn’t.” And I thought that was such a powerful statement about what it means to be engaged. And I wish everyone could embrace that attitude because I think it speaks volumes about what America stands for and the importance of civic engagement.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask you about this notion of civic engagement. You talked about Jackie Robinson and Rosa Parks, which is inspiring. But what is it? Civic engagement, activism, involvement, what is it? What is citizenship?
### Human: Citizenship is about participating in the democratic process. It’s about understanding that government exists to serve the interests of its citizens. It's about respecting the rule of law and adhering to the Constitution. But it's also about recognizing that there are certain obligations that come along with that participation. And that includes voting, but it also includes paying taxes and obeying traffic laws and respecting property rights. It involves being responsible and accountable for our decisions. And I believe that that's a key ingredient for success both personally and collectively. In fact, I believe it’s one of the reasons why America has been able to endure and thrive over the course of several centuries.
There have always been periods where we’ve fallen short of living up to the ideals of our founding documents. But even during moments of turmoil and uncertainty, we’ve managed to preserve basic institutions that allow us to govern ourselves and pursue our own individual ambitions within a framework established by generations before us. And I think that that demonstrates a core commitment among Americans to live up to our values and abide by our rules. Even when we disagree with each other, even when our nation seems divided, we still find common ground on which to stand together.
### Assistant: So civic engagement is an active, intentional effort to participate in our democracy. Is there any advice you could give people who want to engage in that? Is it possible to be passive?
### Human: No. I think the only way that democracy works is through participation. I think if you're going to be an effective citizen, you have to understand how the system works and be willing to play your part in the process. And there are a variety of ways to do that. Whether it's volunteering in your local school district, or joining a neighborhood watch program, or helping organize a political campaign, or running for office yourself, there are lots of opportunities for you to make your voice heard and contribute to the larger debate. And I hope that everybody takes advantage of those opportunities because they really matter.
So I guess the bottom line is that citizenship isn't about sitting back and waiting for someone else to solve problems; it's about getting involved and taking responsibility for creating solutions. And I think that's something that all of us ought to be mindful of as we move forward.
