### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think America is the greatest country in the world?
### Human: I don't know that there are any easy answers to this question because it's one that we can ask ourselves in different ways. And if you define greatness simply based upon our military power and economic might, then obviously there are some other countries out there that would have a claim to be greater than us. But if we look at what makes us great compared to say the people that came before us, so the Founders who had this extraordinary political experiment which was predicated on certain core values around liberty and equality of opportunity, they didn’t get everything right but they did create something remarkable. If we compare ourselves against other nations that are still struggling towards democracy and freedom and equal rights, then I think we ought to feel pretty good about how far we’ve come. Obviously, there’s always room for improvement, but if you measure us against folks like Nelson Mandela in South Africa, he said that we were the only nation in the world to free itself rather than having been freed; that we have a system that over time has become more open, tolerant, and inclusive; that even though we sometimes fall short of those ideals, we still believe deeply in them. So I think we ought to take pride in that. And I also think that when you go overseas, especially after I left office, you see young men and women who have sacrificed their lives or their limbs for us, whether they’re Americans or not, because they believe in our exceptionalism and they
### Assistant: Believe in those things. They believe in those things. That’s really interesting because they’re putting their own life on the line, risking their life for others because they believe. Because they love this idea of freedom and justice and all these things we’re talking about. And they put themselves forward to defend that.
### Human: Well, I mean, they’re doing it because they understand the value of human beings regardless of race or religion or creed or sexual orientation.
### Assistant: I’m just curious. There’s such a strong sense of patriotism among Americans. How important is patriotism today? To you personally, do you find yourself getting emotional about your country? Do you find yourself singing “God Bless America” every once in awhile?
### Human: Yeah, absolutely. You know, as a kid growing up, I remember going through all the usual rites of passage, learning about the Revolutionary War and Civil War and World Wars I and II. And I’d listen to speeches by John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan and Martin Luther King Jr. and others. And I would hear those words and they would move me. And I think part of what it means to be a citizen is to recognize that the country has its flaws and that we have to work constantly to make sure that we live up to our highest ideals. But at the same time, if you asked me, “What does it mean to be an American?” The answer is that I am proud of the fact that despite the imperfections and notwithstanding some of the mistakes that we’ve made along the way, we are also willing to strive to do better. We’re willing to learn from our past. We’re willing to try to improve. We’re willing to compromise. We may fight about how best to achieve that, but ultimately I believe we want to see ourselves and each other succeed. I believe we want everybody to be able to contribute. I think we’re not perfect, but overall I think we’re a force for good.
### Assistant: In terms of striving for perfection, are there aspects of the United States government that worry you or that you think are moving backwards or need to be improved?
### Human: I’ll give you an example of something that worries me. One of the things that happened during my administration is that we created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which basically was designed to protect consumers when they interact with financial institutions. It sounds simple enough. And it was intended to fill a gap because banks were allowed to essentially cheat customers without recourse because they could charge whatever fees they wanted and there wasn’t much that could be done about it. What ended up happening is Wall Street got together and lobbied against it and convinced members of Congress that somehow this was a big threat to the economy and therefore it should be dismantled. Now, maybe that’s true, but if it is, it’s a reason why you should strengthen it instead of weakening it. It seems to me to be common sense that anybody who borrows money from somebody else deserves basic protections. Whether they borrow $500 from a payday lender or $30 trillion from the Federal Reserve, they deserve to be treated fairly. And yet what you saw happen over the last several years is a concerted effort to chip away at consumer protection laws and financial regulations. And now suddenly we’re hearing people saying we need to deregulate Wall Street again and let them do whatever they want to do. My attitude is that while markets are critical, they also require rules and safeguards in order to function effectively and equitably.
### Assistant: That’s an interesting critique of the consumer side of things. On the business side, it feels like there’s more regulations and less regulation. So on the finance industry, specifically.
### Human: Well, yeah. The thing that happened after the Great Recession is that Congress basically passed a law called Dodd-Frank that said, “Okay, we’re gonna tighten up regulation. Here are the rules.” Then what happens is you have this kind of ongoing pressure coming from Wall Street to say, “Well, we wanna roll back regulations,” and it often comes down to the same companies lobbying against themselves because if you loosened the restrictions on one bank, well, guess what? Your competitor is gonna be able to undercut you on price or expand into new areas that you couldn’t previously afford. But what happens is Wall Street doesn’t care about that stuff. All they care about is making money, and they’ll figure out a way to game the system in some fashion. Unfortunately, that dynamic plays out in Washington too where you’ve got lobbyists representing both sides of the equation. Sometimes they’re working against their clients interests because they’re trying to cut deals that benefit somebody else. And unfortunately, too many of these deals involve giving tax breaks to rich individuals or corporations in exchange for nothing tangible. Like the recent deal that we recently passed, I think it’s called the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, was supposed to stimulate the economy and grow jobs. Instead, most of the benefits went to wealthy individuals and large corporations. They gave tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires. They cut corporate taxes dramatically. Meanwhile, the rest of us
