### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think you are still one of the most polarizing presidents in history?
### Human: Well, I hope that’s not true anymore because I’ve left office now for seven years. But during my time in office, there were certainly people who felt very strongly about either loving me or hating me. And they would make their case on social media or at town halls or wherever else they got their information. And what was interesting about it is that even though we had these huge disagreements, when it came down to it, everybody knows that if something terrible happens, like a mass shooting, the local police chief and the mayor turns to the president and says, “Can you help us?” Even those folks who don’t agree with much that I did politically, they want our democracy to work. They recognize that nobody wants to see some crazy person with a gun randomly killing people in a movie theater or at a nightclub. So they understand that we need a system where we can count on our government agencies working together to respond to that kind of threat. Likewise, if there’s a natural disaster somewhere, If there’s a tsunami in Indonesia or a hurricane hits Florida, then everybody understands that the federal government needs to be mobilized to provide assistance and that the people who are going to get the short end of that stick are those whose lives have already been disrupted. They may not care whether or not somebody in Washington gets their feelings hurt because they disagree with me. But they understand that this is about them and their families and that they’re depending upon
### Assistant: Government to step up in times of crisis.
### Human: Exactly. That’s why during my eight years as president, I tried to emphasize again and again that while we may have different political views and we might argue about taxes and budgets and all kinds of things, ultimately we share certain core values and those include a sense of responsibility towards each other and a recognition that when bad stuff happens, we’re all better off when everyone is pulling in the same direction rather than having a zero sum game where your success depends on someone else’s failure.
So I actually think that many Americans understood that even if they didn’t always agree with everything I said or did. And so although there were plenty of people out there who were just waiting to say mean things about me, I also found that there were more people who wanted us to pull together and get the job done. Because we all knew that when the job was getting done well, it meant safer streets and less traffic and kids who weren’t sitting around twiddling their thumbs but instead learning new skills and understanding how to problem solve. It means cleaner air and water, and it means that if somebody’s business is struggling, that maybe they’ll get some extra support from the Small Business Administration. Or if a family’s facing some financial hardship because somebody lost their job, they know that the last thing they should worry about is whether or not Uncle Sam will bail them out. So I really appreciated that spirit and it helped me to try to keep focused on what mat
### Assistant: What is the most constructive way forward? You’ve written recently, “I believe that even after all this time, we’ve never fully reckoned with what took place.” Can you elaborate on that?
### Human: I think that part of it goes back to the fact that there’s no easy answer as to exactly what happened on January 6th and why. There isn’t one simple reason. Some people clearly were motivated purely by racism and white supremacy. Others clearly were motivated by a sense that somehow they were entitled to take advantage of the largesse of the United States government. Others were motivated purely by a desire to overturn a legal election. And others, I suspect, were motivated by a combination of all three. But whatever their motivation was, they showed up that day thinking that they could somehow intimidate Congress into doing something that it wasn’t supposed to do under our Constitution. They thought they could stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory by sheer force. And they ended up getting into the building and then behaving badly once they got inside. The question then becomes: How do we learn lessons from that? How do we prevent something similar from happening again? And the honest answer is that we probably won’t ever know precisely what happened that day until we have access to all the intelligence that law enforcement agencies collected and also all the communications between various groups. And frankly, the best we’ll likely get right now is a Congressional investigation that looks backward. In order to avoid something like that from happening again, we’re going to have to ask ourselves hard questions about how our own systems of government work. Are they designed to handle challenges when somebody comes along and tries
### Assistant: To overturn the results of elections?
### Human: When somebody comes along and tries to subvert the peaceful transition of power, yes. We’ve seen this happen before, both in this country and elsewhere. One hundred years ago, there was a military coup in Brazil. A few decades later, there was a junta in Greece. Then in Chile, there was a coup against Salvador Allende. He was replaced by General Augusto Pinochet, who ruled for over twenty years until he was eventually forced out. Here in the United States, we haven’t had any serious problems related to coups since the 1800s. But we’ve had plenty of close calls. For example, in 1839, there was a failed attempt to overthrow the government of Mexico City. Then in 1857, there was another failed coup attempt against the government in Veracruz. In 1899, there was yet another failed coup attempt against the government in Santiago de Cuba. And finally, in 1961, there was a failed coup d’état against the government of Fidel Castro in Havana.
Each of these cases involved some combination of violence, threats, and economic pressure. None of them succeeded. And none of them fundamentally changed the underlying political situation. But they did underscore the fragility of democratic governments and the importance of keeping them strong.
And so what we need to do is to look at these past experiences and
### Assistant: And the present one too.
### Human: And the present one. Yes. Make sure that we strengthen our institutions and make sure that they’re resilient enough to withstand the sorts of shocks that inevitably occur. And that includes making sure that our electoral process is secure and that voting rights are protected. It also involves making sure that our civil liberties are respected and that our criminal justice system operates fairly and impartially. Finally, it means standing up for America’s leadership role in the world. Because even though we’ve faced setbacks and occasional failures, overall, our system of governance and our nation’s commitment to advancing human freedom around the globe has been one of the main engines of progress in recent centuries.
But unfortunately, today we find ourselves in a situation where too many countries are questioning whether the U.S. is reliable partner. Whether or not we’re going to continue to lead the world in the way that previous generations of Americans have. And that makes it harder for us to address global problems such as terrorism and nuclear proliferation and climate change.
