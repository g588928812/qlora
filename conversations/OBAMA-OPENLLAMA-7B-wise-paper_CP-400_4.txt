### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think we're living through such divisive times?
### Human: I think that there are always going to be points when people disagree. And if they don't have strong beliefs about how to solve problems, then it's easy for disagreements to escalate into conflict. So that's one factor. Another factor is that technology is making it easier than ever before to get your information from sources other than mainstream media outlets. And so we can find ourselves sort of cocooning up inside of our own echo chambers. where we only see news stories that reinforce what we already believe. And then those beliefs are reinforced. So we're not getting challenged. We're not learning new things. And that creates even more polarization because everybody ends up with this set of facts that confirm their existing biases. And they end up having less and less empathy towards people who don't agree with them. So I think that all those factors contribute to the fact that we are now seeing greater division between Americans than at any time since the Civil War. Now, part of the reason why I wanted to come on this podcast is to say that this isn’t something inevitable. It doesn’t have to be like this. In the past, people were able to disagree without resorting to violence. They weren’t constantly yelling at each other across the aisle, “You are an enemy!” There was still some basic level of mutual respect. And that means that we need to redouble our efforts to make sure that we treat each other decently
### Assistant: I want to ask a few questions along these lines. What are the solutions to this divide? Should we be looking to social media platforms to censor misinformation? Should we look to laws that regulate speech? Should we try to somehow restore civility to the political discourse? Is it possible?
### Human: Well, we should certainly be concerned about misinformation spreading online. That's obviously a problem. But we also need to recognize that we shouldn't just assume that all forms of expression are equally valuable. For example, I know that sometimes people will use their free speech rights to shout down speakers whom they disagree with. And they may justify that by saying, well, I want to protect my right to speak freely. But I think that it would be better if people were more willing to listen to opposing views and engage in genuine debate rather than just shouting somebody else down. Similarly, I think we ought to encourage people to express themselves in ways that aren’t offensive or insulting. Because while free speech does include the right to criticize ideas, it does not include the right to deliberately offend someone. And I think that it’s important for us to remember that even though we live in a democracy, that doesn't mean that everybody has equal power. People have different levels of influence depending upon the size of their following. And we owe it to people whose voices might otherwise go unheard to ensure that they're treated with dignity and respect. Finally, I think that we also have a responsibility to make sure that we don't demonize entire groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc. When we do that, we risk creating divisions between people that can never be repaired. If you call somebody a
### Assistant: Racist, homophobic, xenophobe, Islamophobe, etc., etc.
### Human: Right, or transphobic, sexist, etc., etc. You name it, if you start labeling certain kinds of people as inherently evil or morally defective, Then you run the risk of alienating the very allies that you need to build bridges to people who disagree with you. So I think that there are many steps that we can take to reduce the level of division in America, but none of them is going to be easy. And unfortunately, none of them is guaranteed to work, either.
### Assistant: Do you think we could bring back some of the institutions that existed during previous generations, like local newspapers? Local newspapers are really important to the functioning of democracy.
Yes, I think that's true. Unfortunately, they have gone out of business in large numbers over the last decade due to the rise of internet giants like Facebook and Google. These companies didn't create the problems that they are facing today. But they did exacerbate them by allowing advertisers to target consumers based on their interests and habits rather than simply buying ads based on broad demographic categories. As a result, small businesses that relied solely on newspaper advertising found themselves struggling to reach customers who were increasingly tuning out traditional media outlets in favor of online alternatives.
However, even though they've lost much of their economic viability, newspapers remain essential to civil society because they provide citizens with accurate information about what's happening around them. Without access to independent reporting, voters would be left to rely entirely on politicians and pundits for their knowledge about issues such as health care reform or foreign policy decisions. As a result, elected officials would be far less accountable to constituents because they wouldn't necessarily know what was actually taking place behind closed doors. Newspapers play a crucial role in holding government accountable by providing critical oversight on behalf of citizens. Without them, our democracy would suffer greatly.
### Human: Well, there are definitely challenges in terms of figuring out how to pay journalists and editors, given the decline of ad revenue. But I think that we need to continue supporting quality journalism. One thing that I worry about is when cable networks and talk radio stations become substitutes for traditional news organizations. Those channels tend to emphasize opinionated commentary rather than investigative reporting. And I think that that's problematic because it leads people to form opinions based on incomplete or inaccurate information instead of seeking out alternative viewpoints. Additionally, we should support public broadcasting stations like PBS and NPR which offer nonpartisan coverage of events that may not receive extensive attention elsewhere. Ultimately, we need to ensure that everyone has access to reliable information regardless of whether they subscribe to specific news outlets or not.
### Assistant: How about education? How do you see education playing in the solution of the current divide?
### Human: Education is incredibly important because it helps prepare young people for success in life by teaching them skills such as literacy and numeracy as well as values such as honesty and integrity. However, I think that education alone cannot address every issue facing our country today. After all, some individuals choose to drop out of school early and pursue careers outside of academia, such as construction workers or truck drivers. Furthermore, while education provides students with valuable tools to succeed professionally later on, it doesn't guarantee that they'll be happy or fulfilled throughout their lives. Therefore, it's important for parents and teachers alike to stress the importance of developing passions beyond academics so that children develop a sense of purposefulness regardless of whether or not they enter a lucrative profession.
