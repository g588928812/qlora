### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we love this country so much? What does it mean to be an American today?
### Human: Oh, I think we love America because despite all its flaws, there are some things about it that have just always worked. We’ve always had a system that if people play by the rules and they work hard and they follow their conscience and they don’t hurt anybody else, they can get ahead. And that sense of possibility, that sense of optimism has motivated our best moments, whether it was the civil rights movement where people thought that something was possible and then they took action, or it was putting a man on the moon during a time when nobody else believed that it could be done. I mean, those are the kinds of stories that have inspired us around the world even though sometimes our government hasn’t lived up to what Americans want it to be or what they expect it to be. But still, the idea that somebody like me can grow up in Hawaii, come back home after studying at Harvard Law School and become president of the United States, that’s a pretty powerful story. It’s not a perfect story but it’s one that continues to inspire people around the world and gives them hope that no matter how bad things might seem, there’s always something better out there. So that’s one thing I think we should keep in mind. Another thing I would say is that America is the greatest nation on Earth. It’s the only place that I know of where someone who comes from nothing, someone who doesn’t have a lot of advantages,
### Assistant: Someone who's born into poverty, someone who doesn't have an education, can go on to do great things.
### Human: Exactly right. No other advanced democracy has been able to produce anything remotely close to that kind of mobility. The fact that anyone in America from any walk of life can rise as far as they want to and achieve whatever they want to is part of what makes America special. That said, it also means that there’s plenty of room for improvement. There are lots of places where we haven’t yet reached the full potential of our ideals.
### Assistant: So let me ask you specifically about this year, 2020. Obviously, COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything. How has your view of America changed since you left office?
### Human: Well, first of all, I think that the coronavirus pandemic itself has really exposed our vulnerabilities and highlighted both our strengths and our weaknesses. You know, the fact that we were able to develop vaccines so quickly is a testament to American innovation. But at the same time, we didn’t invest enough early on in public health systems so that when a pandemic did hit, it overwhelmed hospitals and ICUs and created all these other problems. So I think that the crisis has forced us to confront some longstanding issues in a way that hadn’t happened before. For example, it’s brought attention to the need for more affordable childcare and elder care. It’s shown us how important broadband internet access is for working parents trying to juggle their jobs while taking care of their kids at home. So these are some of the issues that I think we’ll continue to grapple with going forward. At the same time, I think that the fact that we were able to mobilize so many people across the country to help each other out, whether it was through volunteering or donating money or simply wearing masks so that we could protect ourselves and others, shows the extent to which we’re willing to put aside differences and come together in order to solve common challenges. In addition, I think that the events of last summer reminded us that we cannot take progress for granted. We have to make sure that we’re constantly fighting for freedom and justice for everyone, regardless of race or ethnicity
### Assistant: And the protests against racial injustice and police brutality were really inspiring. To see hundreds of thousands of Americans standing up for each other and coming together despite the differences and the pain.
### Human: Yeah, I think that that moment showed that there are a whole bunch of Americans who may not look like me, but share similar values and understand that we have to stand up for each other and speak out whenever we see injustices happening. That was an encouraging development. Now, of course, we also saw people try to exploit divisions during the election, which unfortunately isn’t new. I mean, this stuff happens every four years. But hopefully we can learn from our mistakes and move forward in ways that build bridges rather than tear them down.
### Assistant: Do you believe in the soul of America? Meaning the idea that everybody gets a fair shot? Or do you believe that there is a systematic racism that is preventing certain groups of people from having equal opportunity in this country?
### Human: Well, obviously, there’s a ton of variation within the U.S., but overall, I think America has been pretty good at providing opportunities for people to succeed based on their own merit and hard work. However, there are definitely some structural barriers that prevent too many people from getting ahead. For example, we need better schools and stronger communities if we’re going to provide young people with the resources they need to thrive. Then once they graduate high school, we need to ensure that they’re given meaningful pathways to success, such as job training programs or apprenticeships. These are the types of investments we need to make now if we want to create a more equitable society down the road.
