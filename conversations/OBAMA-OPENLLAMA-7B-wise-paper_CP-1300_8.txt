### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we need a strong leader like a president? What role does that play in our government today?
### Human: Well, I think there's always going to be some need for somebody at the top who can bring people together around common goals. And so whether it's a president or a prime minister or a monarch, they may not have all the power, but they are the one person who can convene other leaders around certain agreed upon priorities. They can help shape public opinion and galvanize people behind those priorities. So I don't see why that would necessarily go away. That said, what I think is different about modern presidents is their ability to use new technologies to get out directly to the public without having to rely on traditional media gatekeepers. You know, back when I was running for office, if you wanted to talk to voters, you had to make a TV ad, you had to hit the stump, you had to get your message through newspaper editorial boards or, you know, sometimes even radio interviews. Today, anyone can put up a YouTube video or a Facebook post and potentially millions of people could hear what they have to say. There’s no such thing anymore as a “gatekeeper.” So what that means is that because of these technologies, more than ever before, any one individual can really matter, especially if they’re willing to harness technology. It doesn't mean every one of us needs to become a president. But what it does mean is that anybody who wants to make a difference now has more tools available to them than ever before.
### Assistant: The tools are getting better and better, which leads me to this question. How important is social media and how much should we worry about its influence on our society?
### Human: Well, there's obviously good and bad ways to use social media. And right now, unfortunately, the most prominent way people are using it seems to just be to spread around the kind of information that makes everybody feel as though they've got the right to an opinion no matter how uninformed they might be. And that ends up leading to more division rather than less. Because instead of having to persuade someone else, “hey, let’s try to figure this out,” everyone feels entitled to their own viewpoints and nobody’s listening to each other. So I guess where I come down is that we shouldn't necessarily expect too much from social media. We shouldn't assume that somehow these platforms will automatically lead towards greater civility and understanding between people. But neither should we give up hope entirely. I mean, there are still plenty of examples where people are using it to find common ground and to learn something new. So we shouldn't lose faith entirely in social media, but we also shouldn't expect too much either.
### Assistant: When you look at the current presidential election, and maybe we can take a side note of who your preferred candidate is), what do you see as the biggest problems with the process?
### Human: Well, the main problem is that both parties seem to cater almost exclusively to their base rather than trying to build consensus across the aisle. So instead of having a situation where there are two sides that each represent 35% of the country, we end up having one side that represents 35%, another side that represents 35%. And then whoever gets 60% of the vote becomes president. Now, that used to happen rarely, but since 1980, it's happened basically every time except for 2008 and 2012, when I was on the ballot. So we need to rebuild some sort of center in our politics. Unfortunately, I think both political parties have found themselves in a self-reinforcing feedback loop where they only need to keep their base happy in order to stay viable. If they stray off message, then their base might desert them. So instead of trying to reach out to swing voters or compromise with the other party, both parties are just catering to their respective bases. So we need to break out of that cycle and we need to somehow find some common ground again.
### Assistant: Do you see room for competition within the Democratic Party?
### Human: Oh yeah. Competition is healthy! (laughs) I mean, that’s part of what made me successful as a candidate—the fact that I was able to compete against Hillary Clinton. I actually thought she was gonna win until pretty late into the campaign. And once she started losing a few key states, I realized that it wasn't over yet. And so I think that helped me connect with voters in a way that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise. But yes, absolutely, there should be healthy competition among Democrats. That's how you ensure that whoever emerges as the nominee is truly the best possible choice to serve as our next president.
### Assistant: And so in terms of the actual mechanics of campaigning and competing for the nomination, what did you find to be most effective?
### Human:Well, it depends on whom you ask. My strategy depended largely on who you were talking to. For example, if you asked me what I did during the primary debates, I would tell you that I spent most of my time criticizing my opponents rather than talking about myself. But if you were to ask a group of undecided voters afterwards, they’d probably remember more about what I said than anything else that happened during those debates. So while I might not have seemed very Presidential during those early stages of the race, ultimately it paid off in the form of lots of positive attention from potential supporters who felt like they finally saw somebody who was willing to call out his rivals for their flaws rather than simply attack their ideas.
### Human: In terms of what I did during the general election, well, I mostly stuck to policy issues rather than personal attacks. Of course, I couldn't help making fun of Mitt Romney's “binders full of women” gaffe. But overall, I tried to focus on explaining why my vision for America was better than the alternative. And I think that approach worked pretty well. I won reelection with 332 electoral votes, more than any sitting president since Ronald Reagan. So clearly there were enough people out there who were willing to listen to reason rather than just reflexively oppose whatever my opponent proposed.
