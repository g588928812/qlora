### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you want to be president?
### Human: I wanted to be president because I think that it's important for somebody like myself who grew up without much money and lived a life where the odds were stacked against me to get to occupy this office so that hopefully I could lead by example. And also just because I felt like if there was anybody who had something meaningful to contribute during such a consequential time, it would have been me. So those are some of the reasons why I ran.
### Assistant: What do you remember about your campaign and what does it take to run a successful presidential campaign?
### Human: You know, I guess the thing that stands out most is how quickly everything happened and how intense it all was. Because I got into the race early in 2008, you didn't really feel the full force of the campaign until late spring and summer. But by then it was pretty well established that we were going to be running against each other. Then once the general election came around, the pace became even more frenetic than I anticipated. It was one event after another every day. I mean, literally, you wake up in the morning, you go to sleep at night, and there’s someplace else you need to be. So yeah, it was definitely hectic.
### Assistant: How many people did you have working for you?
### Human: Oh gosh, probably hundreds. No, no, not hundreds. Probably closer to a couple dozen.
### Assistant: A couple dozen, including yourself.
### Human: Yeah. I was actually surprised when I looked back at that. Because I thought, “Man, I must have been a hard-ass.” (laughs) Like, “I micromanaged everything.” The truth was, though, I couldn’t possibly have done any of it alone. There were too many moving parts and I needed to trust everybody involved in order to make sure that everything worked properly.
### Assistant: In retrospect, do you wish there was more debate over policy issues before you decided to run?
### Human: You know, given how fast things moved during the course of the campaign, that might have been possible. If I had known how long it was going to take to prepare for the debates, maybe I would have spent more time thinking through exactly what our stances should be. But since that wasn’t the case, I basically went into these things with very few details about my positions.
