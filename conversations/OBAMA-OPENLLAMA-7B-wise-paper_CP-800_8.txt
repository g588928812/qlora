### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think there's so much racism in America?
### Human: That is one of those questions that I think we all have to wrestle with. And it's not easy. It is part of our history. We are better than this. But it also is hardwired into human nature. There was slavery; that's why we had the Civil War. Jim Crow laws; separate but equal; George Wallace standing at the doorway of the university saying no black kids can come through. You know, the Tulsa race massacre, where white mobs descended upon a neighborhood in Oklahoma City and burned down the entire Greenwood District because they were looting. There have been times when it has felt like the country hasn’t lived up to its founding principles. And even today, you see some evidence of it, unfortunately.
I think the way that we combat it is what you just said, which is we're better than this. We have always been better than this. I think there's still a lot of work to be done. But the best antidote to these kinds of divisions is to say, we've got more in common than divides us. When I meet somebody and their skin color is different than mine, or they come from another faith tradition or another background, it doesn't mean we instantly agree about everything. But if they share something important with me, then maybe we can find common ground on other things. That's how I approached people throughout my career. Whether it was working across
### Assistant: the aisle in Congress or whether it was talking to folks overseas or meeting Vladimir Putin face to face. The same approach applies.
### Human: Exactly right. So I think we need to look out for each other. Sometimes we get too caught up in our differences. We forget how much we have in common. One thing that I try to remind myself of is that I probably wouldn't have ended up running for office unless my wife and I decided to move to Illinois in 1985. Because nobody else in my family, certainly none of my extended family members, has ever run for political office before. And yet, somewhere along the line, my parents decided to send me to live with a man named Frank Robinson in Hawaii. He was a distant relative. Frank was a Republican and he lived on the far end of Oahu. And he didn't really want to take me in. My mom asked him and he was reluctant. But ultimately, he did. And that meant that my mom sent me halfway around the world. And while she wasn't happy about it at the time, I turned out okay. And I went to Punahou School, which is a great school over there. They don't teach you anything about Hawaiian history until your senior year. And I wound up getting recruited to play basketball at Columbia University. But the reason that I wound up going to Columbia is that a woman in Honolulu named Ann Dunham gave birth to me. She was born in Kansas and her father worked on the Santa Fe railroad. Her mother was raised on a farm near Chicago. And somehow these
### Assistant: disparate pieces fit together. If we're looking at the big picture, what makes America great? Is it its diversity? What is the source of our greatness?
### Human: Yeah, well, I guess I would make three points. First of all, I think we should celebrate our differences. But we shouldn't let those differences divide us. Secondly, I think we should value tolerance above all else. And finally, I think we should recognize that while we may have a Constitution that says everyone's equal, we haven't always lived up to those ideals. And we're still striving toward them. So I mentioned earlier that when I go to places like Poland, where I visited last summer, I see people who share many values with Americans, but whose governments don't always reflect those values. And sometimes they don't respect the rule of law. Or they don't give women the kind of rights and opportunities that we believe every girl deserves. So I think that we can never rest on our laurels. Even though we've made progress, we need to continue to push forward.
And I think if you ask young people, they'll tell you that they expect us to keep moving ahead.
### Assistant: In terms of pushing forward, you were the first president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge. How did this momentous trip change you personally?
### Human: Well, it reminded me of the fact that we've got a long journey left to travel on this planet. And that's true whether you're visiting Havana or whether you're heading off to Bora Bora tomorrow. And it reminded me that there's lots of opportunity for cooperation between countries, including between neighbors. As soon as I took office, I announced that we would begin normalizing relations with Cuba after decades of frozen Cold War policy. And it turns out that Cuba, despite its reputation, is actually a vibrant society. Cubans are warm and welcoming. Their literacy rate is higher than ours. They're doing cutting edge research on stem cell treatment. So it was a reminder that we can't judge nations based solely on their government or their rhetoric. We ought to judge them based on actual facts.
But mostly, I hope that the Cuban people feel like they can chart their own course now. Because when I was growing up, my grandparents couldn't just hop on a plane and fly to Miami and catch a flight home. They needed a visa. Nowadays, anybody can do that. It's not just Cubans who benefit from greater freedom and connectivity around the globe. It's everybody.
### Assistant: Speaking of grandchildren, Malia and Sasha are now adults, both graduated college. Can you talk about raising daughters and sons in this era of social media, and what advice you have for families in general?
### Human: Sure. Well, first of all, they're terrific kids. And they're both in grad school now, pursuing their dreams. I love seeing them grow up. I'm proud of them. I'm grateful that they call me “Pops.” And they've got their whole lives ahead of them. And they're gonna do great stuff.
