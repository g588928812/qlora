### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did America vote for Donald Trump?
### Human: It's a great question because it gets at this underlying issue about how divided our country is right now. I think there are some people who legitimately were drawn to Mr. Trump’s message during that campaign. They felt like their jobs had dried up or they were losing ground economically; that trade deals weren’t working for them. There was legitimate concern about security issues related to terrorism or immigration. So there are folks who can make those arguments, but when I talk to those folks today, what they tell me is they didn't expect Mr. Trump to govern the way he did. And they also don’t believe that everything he promised turned out to be true. In fact, if anything, things got worse. For example, the economy didn't create more jobs. The stock market didn't go through the roof. Our international standing took another hit around the world. He couldn’t get Congress to pass any of the things he wanted to do on health care or infrastructure spending or education. And so they feel like they were sold something false, which means that they have buyer’s remorse. That doesn’t mean that everybody who voted for him did so because they were tricked into voting against their own interests, although there are clearly plenty of folks who fit into that category. But the larger point is just that we have a lot of problems in our society that have not been addressed in ways that would give ordinary Americans hope. And Mr. Trump
### Assistant: Is that the problem? We haven't been addressing these problems.
### Human: Well, look, I think there's no doubt that the system has become less responsive over time. That's certainly part of the reason why people are frustrated. Whether it's wages going down, whether it's long commutes, whether it's having trouble paying your bills. All these are real concerns and they all contribute to people feeling alienated. I will say that this was happening before Mr. Trump came along. When he ran for president, he rode a wave of dissatisfaction among the electorate that goes back many years. You know, I remember growing up in the late ’80s and early ’90s, when Ronald Reagan left office and George H.W. Bush was in charge, and then Bill Clinton became president, and we went through the era of NAFTA and other free trade agreements. And I watched my father lose his job during that period. My dad was a blue collar worker, and he worked at Caterpillar for decades, until they moved the factory overseas. And he struggled for several years after that, trying to figure out what he could do. He ended up taking a series of minimum wage jobs, ultimately retiring on disability benefits. And so I saw personally how difficult it was for somebody who worked hard all his life and lost his job due to forces beyond his control. So I think Mr. Trump tapped into a frustration that has been simmering in our economy and in our politics for quite some time. Now
### Assistant: So that's one explanation, but let's take it further than that. Why aren’t politicians listening to the voice of regular people? Why aren't they solving these problems?
### Human: I think one reason is that we've allowed ourselves to get trapped in a political duopoly where essentially the same set of ideas come from the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. And so whoever wins an election isn't really viewed as representing the full range of views within each party, even though both parties nominate people who claim to represent everyone. So I think there's a fundamental problem there, which is that voters often feel like they're stuck between these two choices, neither of whom represents their values. Another factor is the influence of money in politics. So the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court opened the floodgates for special interest groups and corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money influencing elections. As a result, candidates are forced to raise ever increasing sums of money from wealthy donors in order to run competitive campaigns. And so instead of debating the merits of different policy proposals, we're talking about fundraising and donor lists and PACS and superPACS. And none of that is good for democracy.
### Assistant: So we need to fix the brokenness of our electoral process.
### Human: Absolutely.
### Assistant: And then you need to fix the brokenness of the duopoly.
### Human: Right.
