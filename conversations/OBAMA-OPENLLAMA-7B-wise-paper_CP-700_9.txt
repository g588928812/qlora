### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that someone like Donald Trump was able to win the election? And what does it tell us about our country?
### Human: So I think there are a lot of different answers to this. One of them is simply the Republican Party had sort of ceded its soul to Donald Trump. They didn’t just have him as a candidate; they embraced him. It wasn't just that he won the nomination unexpectedly. But then once he did win the nomination, Republicans rallied around him because they wanted to win. There were folks who thought maybe we should stop this guy, but ultimately they decided, “We want to beat Hillary Clinton.” Then what happened during the campaign was that the kind of core values of the Republican Party began to be upended. They became associated with not only Mr. Trump, but with all kinds of other stuff. That’s one thing that happened.
I also think it reflects a broader sense among voters across the political spectrum that America was changing too fast. People felt like their kids weren't doing as well as their parents had done. They were worried about terrorism. They were feeling anxious about a whole range of things. And they were looking for strong leadership that could help steady things through this period of transition. And so Mr. Trump offered himself up as that strongman. He said, “I can be the rock at the center of your storm,” and people responded to that. Now, having said all that, I also believe that if the Democratic nominee had run a more effective campaign, she would have beaten Mr. Trump. Because what we learned after the fact is
### Assistant: What does “effective” mean here? How would that campaign have looked like?
### Human: Well, I don’t know what her campaign looked like before Election Day. We saw some of the ads they ran. Obviously, the Comey announcement was devastating to her candidacy, and probably would have been even without Mr. Trump's own antics. Beyond that, though, it really comes down to the fundamentals of economics. You look at how many Americans were struggling economically, particularly middle class families, where incomes hadn't gone up much since the Great Recession ended, where people were still underwater on their mortgages, where health care costs were going up, and where there were few prospects for meaningful job growth. The Democrats needed to offer a better economic story than they did. And frankly, I think the debate over Obamacare was a huge missed opportunity. When the ACA passed in 2010, it gave people hope that if you worked hard, you could get ahead again. Unfortunately, most people didn't feel that way by the time the next presidential contest rolled around. And so rather than talk about how important it was to protect Obamacare and build on it, what the Democrats did instead was try to pretend that it was repealable and replaceable, which left them open to the argument that if you liked your insurance plan, you could keep it. If you liked your doctor, you could keep him or her. And the truth is that none of those things was true. As we got closer to Election Day in 2016, they
### Assistant: were more honest about saying that these plans are bad.
### Human: Yes, exactly. And by the time they got to the general election, they had nothing else to say. And unfortunately, that was enough for some people who might otherwise have voted for the Democrats to go vote against Mrs. Clinton rather than for Mr. Trump. And so I think that's part of why she lost. Another reason she lost is because she underestimated how tough it was going to be to defend herself against Mr. Trump's attacks. She thought she could go out and give a good speech and make the case for herself, but she couldn't. In fact, the best thing she ever did was concede defeat quickly when it became clear that she was losing on election night. By contrast, Mr. Trump spent months attacking her, painting her as a criminal, trying to delegitimize her entire candidacy. Even now, he'll attack her whenever he gets a chance. I remember after one of the debates earlier this year, he attacked her for something that happened decades ago. But despite all of that, she kept on talking about issues that mattered to ordinary Americans. She talked about jobs, about raising wages, about education and equal pay for women. These are things that resonated with people, and they helped her win the popular vote. But it was too little, too late.
If you take a longer view of U.S. politics over the last 30 years, you see similar dynamics play out repeatedly. In the
### Assistant: 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, you had Newt Gingrich leading the charge with Contract with America. And then Bill Clinton ran on a message of restoring dignity to the office of the president. and then George W Bush, his father, was supposed to be a moderate conservative and he turned into a very hawkish conservative.
And then Obama came along with Hope and Change and it was all about bringing everybody together, no red states, blue states, and then Trump comes along and he doesn't bring anybody together.
### Human: No, he divides people. Absolutely, absolutely. And that's what he's good at. But it's not just that. Look, I'm somebody who believes strongly that the purpose of government is to promote the common good, to ensure that everyone has a fair shot and a real opportunity to succeed. That means investing in our future and building the infrastructure of tomorrow. It means making sure that every kid in this country has access to a quality education regardless of whether they live in a rich neighborhood or a poor neighborhood. It means making sure that workers have the skills they need to fill the jobs of today and tomorrow. It means ensuring that our basic civil rights are protected and that everyone can participate fully in society. And yet for far too long, Washington has ignored those needs. Instead, politicians have focused almost exclusively on delivering benefits to powerful special interests, big corporations and Wall Street firms, and wealthy individuals, while ignoring the needs of ordinary working families.
So what happens is that the playing field becomes tilted in favor of those with power and money, and everyday Americans find themselves falling further behind. That's the problem we faced in 2008 and 2012. That's the problem we face today. Fortunately, there are solutions available right now. We can invest in our crumbling roads and bridges and outdated transit systems. We can expand access to high-speed internet to every corner of the country. We can provide tax relief
### Assistant: To whom? To who?
### Human: Tax breaks for middle class families and small businesses, so they can afford childcare and send their children to college. We can strengthen the social safety net so that millions of Americans aren't living in poverty, especially seniors who are struggling to pay their bills. None of these programs cost a fortune, and they wouldn't increase deficits or debt, because they'd largely be paid for by closing loopholes and tax havens used by big corporations and the wealthiest Americans. So the challenge for whoever occupies the White House is to put forward an agenda that helps ordinary Americans and gives them a better life. And that's what I tried to do as President. My administration pursued policies to support manufacturing, innovation, clean energy, higher education, worker training, paid leave, equal pay for women, and affordable childcare. All of these proposals would benefit both men and women, because they would allow workers to spend less time worrying about their family finances, and more time focusing on their careers. And by the same token, employers would have more productive employees, which is good news for them too. So my point isn't that women should be favored over men; it's that any policy that strengthens workers and supports businesses will ultimately benefit everybody. And that includes policies aimed specifically at helping women. For example, expanding access to flexible work schedules and paid leave, so that parents can balance their responsibilities at home and at work, makes it easier for men and women
