### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Vladimir Putin is so afraid of color revolution? He’s been using it now since 2008 in Georgia, in 2014 in Ukraine. What does this fear tell us about him and about Russian society that he’s so afraid of these protests?
### Human: Well, I guess the short answer is because they work. So if you look at what happened in Georgia and Ukraine, both those countries had histories where there was some level of popular dissatisfaction over corruption and the quality of government. And when you have leaders who are responsive to their people’s needs and wants, then you don’t necessarily see the need for a color revolution, right? You can just go out there and win elections legitimately, and maybe even have your own political opposition parties that can challenge you. But in cases where governments are corrupt and they’re not delivering services effectively, then you have a void, and somebody will fill that void.
### Assistant: The void can be filled by anybody else. It doesn't matter whether it's a business tycoon, whether it's an oligarch, whether it's some kind of strongman leader like Putin himself, or a political party.
### Human: Exactly. In each case, we saw in those countries where you had legitimate democratic space for challengers to emerge, and that's why you didn’t see them, but once you took away that democratic space, suddenly you had a void that could easily be filled by a guy like Putin who came out of the KGB. And he'd say, well, I know how to run things better than all these other people running around the country. And he'll promise to give you a better life, more jobs, and less poverty, etc., etc. And that's exactly what happened in both countries.
### Assistant: And the problem with that approach though is you get rid of the middlemen. So the people that were able to protest peacefully before are no longer allowed to protest peacefully anymore. They're either killed or imprisoned or silenced somehow. So that leaves only one option left for the citizens, which is this violent uprising.
### Human: Right. And sometimes you also see that within these color revolutions themselves, you might have violence on both sides. Because remember, Russia invaded and occupied Crimea after the Maidan Revolution in Ukraine. There were elements inside Ukraine that wanted to take advantage of the situation and seize power themselves. And there were probably some people on the Ukrainian side who would have loved nothing more than to kill Russians and occupy territory in Crimea. So I think this idea of color revolution is always a double edged sword, and I think that's part of why Putin is so paranoid about it.
### Assistant: Do you think it's fair to say that the majority of Russians want to keep Putin in place?
### Human: Yeah, I mean, I think that's definitely true. You know, I think there's obviously still pockets of dissidents inside Russia and people who are critical of the current regime. But overall, I think there's pretty broad support for Putin among the population, and especially given that most people in Russia don't really feel threatened by the way their lives are going. If anything, they feel better off today than they did back during the Yeltsin years, particularly economically speaking. That said, I think many Russians recognize that there are certain aspects of the system that aren't working very well and that they would prefer to live in a democracy where they can vote for whoever they want and criticize whoever they want without having to worry about getting thrown into prison or disappearing forever.
### Assistant: One thing that’s interesting is that there's an internet access, despite the crackdowns, despite the blocking of sites, there's still a lot of information available to people. They still have access to Twitter, to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and so on. How do you explain that? Is that something that should continue to be encouraged? Is that something that should be limited?
### Human: Oh, I think it definitely should be encouraged, but I also think it's important that we make sure that whatever regulations exist are ones that are consistent with our values and principles as Americans. So I think we need to tread carefully here because freedom of speech isn't just some abstract concept; it has real consequences. For example, hate speech can lead to real acts of violence against minorities and others. And while I understand that we may need to have limits on free speech in order to protect public safety and prevent certain kinds of harms, we shouldn't allow ourselves to become so restrictive that we stifle healthy debate and discussion within civilized societies. So ultimately, what I believe is that we need to find a balance between protecting individual rights and promoting social harmony.
