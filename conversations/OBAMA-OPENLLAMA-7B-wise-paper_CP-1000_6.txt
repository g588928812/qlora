### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think you're still so polarizing today?
### Human: Well, I guess it depends on which numbers we’re looking at because if you’re looking at the generic ballot where people are just asked “who would you vote for?” And it looks like Democrats have a pretty good chance to retake Congress. If that’s what you’re talking about then I think most Americans understand that when I was president, our country went through a really difficult period. The economy tanked; people lost their jobs; we had a lot of folks overseas fighting wars without enough public support; and there were a whole bunch of things happening in terms of social unrest. And there were also some real questions about how well our system works and whether or not government can solve problems. That created a huge amount of frustration. So, if by polarization you mean there’s less trust in institutions broadly speaking and fewer people feel they know each other across lines of race or region or partisanship, then that has been something that has affected all of us since I left office.
### Assistant: But doesn’t it seem that the people who don’t like you are more likely to say so? It seems that your approval ratings were much higher than any president in recent memory, even George W. Bush. I think they’ve both dipped below 50 percent recently. You’re consistently hovering around 60 percent, 70 percent approval rating during your time as president. Doesn’t that make you think that maybe you’re not that unpopular?
### Human: No, look, I think that those people who dislike me have always felt free to voice their opinion. You know, if someone thinks that I’m doing a bad job, they should be able to let me know. They shouldn’t need a Fox News commentator or somebody else to tell them that. And I think the problem is that sometimes, unfortunately, too many folks get their information either through echo chambers online or through places where they only hear one side of an argument. And if they’re not challenged on it, then they tend to become even more convinced that they’re right.
### Assistant: There’s this interesting phenomenon called confirmation bias where you only seek out news sources that confirm what you believe, and then you begin to believe more and more strongly that your worldview is correct. So that might explain why you’re polarizing. Because you’re getting these messages that tell you exactly what you want to hear.
### Human: Yeah. But I think that that dynamic exists regardless of who happens to be in the White House. So, I think that that’s part of the challenge of living in a democracy. We have free speech, and we have a marketplace of ideas. And if someone wants to come up with a crazy idea, they should have every right to put it forward.
### Assistant: But that’s also why we have elections, though, right? To decide who gets to implement crazy ideas.
### Human: Exactly.
### Assistant: But I wonder if there’s ways to test the crazy ideas in a way that prevents you from implementing them.
### Human: Well, that’s part of the beauty of our democracy. Our founders designed a system where there’s no direct election for the president. Instead, voters choose members of the Electoral College who then meet after Election Day and cast votes according to the preferences of their particular state. And although the candidate who wins the popular vote may not necessarily end up becoming president, over the course of our history, whoever ends up winning the electoral college vote almost always becomes president. And that’s because it gives smaller states a bigger say in electing the president and larger states a smaller say in electing the president. And it means that candidates aren’t simply trying to appeal to the largest possible audience, but rather to a broad spectrum of interests.
