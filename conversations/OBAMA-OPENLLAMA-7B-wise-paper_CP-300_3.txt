### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are you optimistic about America? Why do you think it's still such a great country after all these years since you left office? And why do you think that it can continue to be a great nation?
### Human: Well, let me answer your second part first, because I don't want to give people the wrong impression about what I actually think. It's easy to get caught up in this sort of binary notion of either we’re going downhill and everything’s awful or everything's perfect and there's no need to fix anything. And if you look around the world at some of the places where I spent time, whether it was Africa or Asia, or South America, or Europe, there are countries which have done much worse than us in terms of their economic performance and human development. But they haven't had the same level of political stability that we've enjoyed and the same level of civil rights and the same level of freedom that we've enjoyed. So, we should never lose sight of how good things are in this country and how fortunate we are and how lucky we were to live in a place where our basic freedoms were secured and protected.
### Assistant: You mentioned South America. Is Venezuela one of those countries that could be a model? Is Cuba a model? Do you think there's something to learn from Cuba in terms of the way it handles its economy and so forth?
### Human: There's always lessons to learn. But what Cuba has demonstrated over decades is a willingness to reject the notion that capitalism is the only viable system for organizing an economy. I mean, Cuba has a system that's very different from ours in the sense that they've got state control over most sectors of their economy. They've got a command economy. Our system is based on market forces and private ownership. Their system is based on state ownership. They have a single party dictatorship. We have a multi-party democracy. But despite all those differences, they've managed to provide education and health care and housing for virtually everyone. And even though they've been isolated economically for more than half a century from the rest of the world, they've continued to invest heavily in infrastructure and technology. And so, while we might disagree with the method that they use to achieve their objectives, there's no doubt that they've achieved them and provided a decent quality of life for their citizens.
### Assistant: The problem is they don't allow any dissenting opinions whatsoever.
### Human: That's true. In fact, when I went there in 2009, one of the questions I asked myself was, “How does a government survive for five decades?” without allowing any meaningful debate, any dissent, any criticism.” Because that's exactly what happens in dictatorships. People just go along with whatever the regime dictates. They're not allowed to criticize it. They're not allowed to protest against it. If they try to do that, they may end up being thrown into jail or worse.
### Assistant: Can you talk about your experience visiting Cuba? Was it an interesting visit? Were there any insights that stuck out to you?
### Human: Yes. One thing that struck me during the trip was how similar Cuba is to other Latin American countries. There are certain traditions and customs that you find throughout the region. There's a certain food and cuisine that you see. There are certain kinds of music that you hear. Even though their culture is quite distinct from ours and theirs is based on Spanish roots rather than French roots like ours, there's a commonality that exists across the Americas, including Cuba. And I remember talking to some Cubans who had lived outside Cuba for many years and said, “You know, when we came back home, everything seemed the same. Even though we hadn't seen each other in years, it felt like we saw each other yesterday.” And I thought that was a pretty striking comment, but it also underscored the fact that Cuban identity isn't really defined by geography. It's defined by tradition and history and customs and language. And despite the fact that they haven't been able to connect with the rest of the world through travel and trade and commerce, they still feel connected to each other as Cubans.
### Assistant: What did you think about their healthcare system?
### Human: Healthcare is free for everybody. Everybody gets access to medical services regardless of their income. And even though their doctors aren't paid particularly well compared to their counterparts elsewhere, they still tend to receive excellent training and have access to the latest technologies and procedures. And so, they're able to deliver high quality healthcare to their population.
