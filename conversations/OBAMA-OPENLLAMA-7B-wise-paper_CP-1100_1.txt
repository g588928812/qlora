### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected president?
### Human: Well, I'll just tell you what I see. You know, there are certain things that we have seen play out during this last election cycle where I think it’s fair to say that some people were looking for somebody who they could identify with, somebody who would send a signal that “we can turn back the clock,” that “the world order which was established after World War II is somehow no longer relevant.” There's always going to be people who feel like they don't get their share of what's happening around them. And so I think those folks felt that maybe they didn't need somebody who had deep foreign policy experience; that they needed somebody who would simply articulate a vision and who seemed like they understood their concerns better than anybody else. I also think that because of the fact that we live in such a diverse country where increasingly people are moving into communities that look different than they did when their parents grew up, and where many of us don't even understand our own family histories well enough to know whether or not our great grandparents came over here legally or otherwise, we live in a country where there isn't a common culture. That means sometimes we're more easily divided by race, by ethnicity, by religion. And so I think one of the things that this campaign did was it tapped into some of these underlying currents in society. Now, at the same time, the other thing that happened is that if you looked at income inequality and you
### Assistant: saw how wages weren't keeping pace with the cost of living, particularly in big cities like Chicago, Detroit, New York City, etc., then a lot of working class voters may have been saying, hey, Washington ain't got my back right now. They may have felt let down by the system. So those are two separate issues but they're kind of combined together and it feels like there's something about the current political atmosphere that allowed for both of those issues to coalesce into one powerful force that elected Donald Trump.
Human: Absolutely. But I think it's important to note that there are plenty of examples throughout U.S. history where somebody who was relatively unknown rose to power by tapping into the same kinds of sentiments that Mr. Trump did. And so part of the challenge is understanding why someone like him resonated so strongly with so many Americans, especially those who might not ordinarily vote for someone like Hillary Clinton or myself. The good news is that despite the fact that he won the Electoral College, despite the fact that he won the popular vote, he still ended up losing the popular vote overall by almost three million votes. And so that means that more than half of America either voted against him or stayed home. In terms of analyzing why he ultimately prevailed, you know, I think one of the key factors was that he did well among white men without college degrees. And, you know, in recent decades, you know, this group
### Human: has become a declining percentage of the electorate. And so I think that there were a number of reasons for that. Partly, it reflects the fact that there are fewer manufacturing jobs available today than there used to be. But another reason is that many of those folks feel left behind by globalization and technology. And unfortunately, sometimes politicians can exploit that sense of alienation. And I think that's part of what explains why Mr. Trump ended up prevailing in those states where there are fewer white college graduates. Another factor that hurt Secretary Clinton in the end was she couldn't quite generate the enthusiasm that we knew she had in previous elections. And so, you know, young people turned out in lower numbers than expected, and older voters turned out in higher numbers than expected. And again, I think part of it was that they were worried about the future and they wanted to make sure that someone was actually going to be able to protect their interests, whereas younger people were thinking more long term about what's the impact this election is going to have on my kids and my grandkids.
### Assistant: But you've said yourself that your wife Michelle told you before the election, “If you win, everybody gets four years of me; if you lose, they get eight.” What does that mean? Why would she say that? Does she believe that if her husband lost, she will be blamed for his loss?
### Human: She probably didn't mean that literally. It wasn't like she was saying, hey, I'm gonna go on the View and say, oh, you know, I caused the president to lose reelection. No, what she meant was that she was concerned that her daughters were really little girls and she wanted them to grow up feeling like their dad had a chance to serve as president of the United States. And she thought it would be hard for them to reconcile that if they didn't have at least four years with their father in office. Obviously, there are a lot of first ladies whose husbands served only one term. And so it was more of a general observation about how challenging it would be if they were growing up knowing their father served in high public office for eight years versus four years.
### Assistant: Yeah. I want to ask you though. Maybe this is a good moment to talk about your relationship with your wife and how much of an influence she was on you becoming the leader that you became.
### Human: Oh yeah, absolutely. Look, Michelle is everything to me. She is my rock. We've known each other since we were teenagers. We went to the same school. When we were in high school, she lived in my neighborhood. I'd often see her walking home from school, and we eventually started dating. And I learned very quickly early on that she was someone who cared deeply about others, someone who was incredibly smart, and someone who was willing to put herself second while making sure that everyone else's needs were met ahead of hers. I mean, every morning when I woke up, she was already gone and out doing community service somewhere else. I remember once when she had malaria and she insisted on getting up at 5:30AM to make breakfast for me so that I wouldn't get sick too. And that's just one example of how she lives her life every day. I mean, she truly believes that if you want to change the world, the best way to do it is to roll up your sleeves and help others and lead by example. And so she's somebody who I've leaned on heavily during both of my campaigns. And frankly, during most of my adult life. And it's easy to underestimate how important it is to have someone like that in your corner because nobody knows you better than your spouse does. And she understands what motivates you, she understands what makes you tick, she understands what your vulnerabilities
### Assistant: are, she knows how to push you in ways that you might not necessarily expect but which ultimately will allow you to flourish as a human being and as a leader.
### Human: Exactly. Because unlike most politicians, she doesn't try to change me. She accepts me for exactly who I am. And that allows me to do what I do best, which is to listen to people, to find solutions based on what I hear rather than trying to impose my own agenda upon others.
