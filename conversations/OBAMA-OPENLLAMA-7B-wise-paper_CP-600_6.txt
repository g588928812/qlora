### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we have Donald Trump? Why did this person become president? What does it say about us as Americans?
### Human: I think the answer is complicated. There are multiple answers. But I do want to make sure that everybody understands that even though I am tempted to offer up some easy answers that are going to satisfy people, those easy answers aren’t actually the ones that are true because I don't believe that the American public is stupid. And so when somebody offers an explanation that seems too good to be true, there's usually something wrong with that explanation. So what I would suggest is, and I've written about this before, if you look at polling data over time, the percentage of white working class voters who identify themselves as Republicans has gone down dramatically since the early ‘80s. And that number has stabilized around somewhere between 35% and 40%. And then the Democratic Party’s share of support among those same voters has increased, but not nearly enough to offset the Republican Party’s loss of votes. And so basically, what you see is a realignment of the political parties. The Democrats became more liberal and the Republicans became more conservative. And so that creates a situation where both parties are trying to appeal to their base. That was true during the Obama administration and it’s still true today. And so what happened in 2016 is that Hillary Clinton ran as a moderate Democrat, and she lost to somebody whose message seemed much closer to her own party's traditional positions than hers. Now, that doesn't explain why the
### Assistant: White Working Class voted for him instead of her. Right.
### Human: It explains why they didn't vote for her. She got fewer votes than any other Democrat running for president in modern times. And then it also doesn't explain why she wasn't able to attract more of the minority voters who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party. Because if you go back and look historically at all the elections, including the one in which my husband won, you will find that the minority turnout rates were higher when the Democratic candidate won than when the Republican candidate won.
So the problem was that she couldn't generate excitement within the Democratic Party. She couldn't excite African American voters. And I think part of the reason for that was that she had a lot of baggage related to her husband’s legacy. Her husband'd been elected twice; He was very popular. And the fact that she had to run against him, I think, contributed to her having to spend less time developing a compelling message to appeal to African Americans. So that's how we ended up with Trump. But again, I do want to emphasize that although there are a lot of factors that went into that outcome, I don't think most Americans are dumb. They understand that it’s really important to get things done. They know that you can disagree without being disagreeable. They also understand that the government should reflect their values, right? And that means that it needs to include a diversity of perspectives. And they don't want that diversity to come at
### Assistant: Their expense. No, absolutely.
### Human: Which is what happened under Trump.
### Assistant: Yeah, exactly. How do you respond to that?
### Human: Well, let me give you another example. In 2014, I wrote an article called “The Audacity of Hopelessness.” It was about how cynical our politics had gotten during the midterms. We saw a record low turnout. I talked about how angry everybody was feeling, particularly young people. They just felt like everything was hopeless. I suggested that one way out of that trap was for candidates to stop talking about issues and start talking about character. If you could show that you had integrity, that you cared about your constituents, that you weren’t beholden to special interests, maybe you could inspire people to turn out and vote, even though nothing else might be happening. And then the next year, I think the Democratic Party did a pretty good job of that. They nominated a guy named Connor Lamb who was a former Marine who had served overseas and came home to Southwest Pennsylvania and was running against Rick Saccone. He had no national profile whatsoever. But they spent months making him seem relatable and authentic. And they emphasized that this election wasn't about policy, it was about character. And it worked! They flipped a congressional seat in a district that had been held by a member of the Tea Party for eight years. So the point is that despite the fact that people may feel frustrated, despite the fact that they may feel like the system isn’t working, they haven't given up on democracy yet. And we shouldn'
### Assistant: Shouldn't we try harder to make them feel hopeful? Is that possible?
### Human: Absolutely. I mean, the thing about hope is that it's contagious. If you can project optimism onto others, it becomes much easier for them to do the same.
I remember after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, FEMA Administrator Michael Brown gave a press conference where he said, “This is not a Third World country.” He was referring to the fact that there was a shortage of supplies in the city and that many people needed help getting out. But he used language that sounded insulting and dismissive, especially coming from someone in charge of emergency management. When I heard that clip, I thought to myself, “If I was governor of Louisiana, I wouldn't hire this guy.” But I didn't say anything publicly until the next day. When I read that transcript, I realized that this was the moment that I had been waiting for. This was the moment to call BS on Michael Brown and tell America that he was fired. Because every parent who watched that clip knew that what he was saying was bullshit. And they wanted somebody to say it to him directly. So I decided to speak up and say, “Michael Brown has lost control of this operation. He needs to resign.” And that afternoon, he resigned. Everybody understood that if you use words like “third world” and “hurricane,” then you need to be fired. You need to lose your job.
