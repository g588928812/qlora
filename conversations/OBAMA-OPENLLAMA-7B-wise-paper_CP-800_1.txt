### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Trump won? We know why we lost but let's talk about how we lost. Why did Donald Trump become president when Hillary Clinton was expected to win? What went wrong?
### Human: I don’t want to say it all went wrong because there were plenty of reasons that she lost. But this is something where I don't think anybody anticipated what happened. You look back at the polls going into Election Day, they were within the margin of error. And then once again, we saw these same dynamics play out in 2016. The popular vote totals are almost exactly the same, even though this time around she got more votes than she did before, which tells us something interesting about our system. It suggests that if the Electoral College didn't exist, we wouldn't have ended up having two presidents named “Trump” and a vice president named “Pence.” There would have just been one president, which would have probably been somebody else instead. So there are some advantages to having this weird institution called the Electoral College that gives disproportionate weight to states like Wyoming over New York. That's not ideal, obviously. But nonetheless, I think we can see now that even without that advantage, we still managed to get ourselves into the same situation. And so it really does come down to a handful of states. It comes down to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida. If any one of those four had gone differently than they did, we would be talking about someone other than Donald Trump as the president today. Now, it should also be said that Hillary Clinton ran a flawed campaign. She did better against Bernie Sanders than people give her credit
### Assistant: In the primaries, yes.
### Human: In the primaries, right. When you look at the general election, she did everything she could to try to run away from herself. She tried to convince voters that she wasn't trustworthy. She tried to convince voters that she was too hawkish. She tried to convince voters that she couldn't connect with ordinary Americans. None of that worked. She still lost. Some of it was bad luck. But much of it was her own fault. And so I think she bears some responsibility for why she lost. Having said that, there's no doubt that she also had the wind at her back going into Election Day. A lot of things broke her way during the course of the race. And while I don't blame her personally for every mistake that was made along the way, she definitely shares some of the responsibility for why she ultimately came up short.
Now, after the election, there was a sense that somehow it was her fault that she lost. And that's not accurate. I mean, think about the circumstances under which she entered the race. Her husband had just left office eight years earlier. He was still extremely popular across the board among Democrats and Independents. And yet she decided to mount a second bid for the White House anyway. Because she felt that she owed it to the country to offer herself up as a candidate after having spent eight years in the White House. To make sure that whoever followed in her footsteps would be worthy of the
### Assistant: Presidency.
### Human: Right. And so she knew that she might lose. Nobody knows whether they're going to lose until they actually go through with their plans. But she decided to do it anyway. And I think most reasonable people understand why she did that. And I think most reasonable people understood that even if she hadn't been the best candidate, if she had just been slightly better prepared and slightly less prone to gaffes and mistakes, maybe she wins the nomination. Maybe she wins the primary. Then maybe she doesn't need to face the Republican nominee in the fall. Perhaps she can coast to victory against Mike Pence. After all, nobody wants to elect a sitting Vice President. They want to choose their own person. So maybe she gets elected without ever needing to debate Donald Trump. Maybe she never needs to go toe to toe with him in front of a live audience. But nevertheless, she ends up getting nominated, and then she proceeds to lose the general election despite all of those headwinds, despite all those advantages. And that's because of something far more fundamental than anything that she did. It was because of the map itself. It was because of these small handful of key battleground states that were able to deliver the electoral college for Donald Trump. And so I guess my point is that while she may bear some responsibility for some of the decisions that she made along the way, ultimately, the reason she lost was because the state of the economy, it was because the
### Assistant: state of the nation, the world was such that Donald Trump was able to benefit from that in ways that she wasn't able to.
### Human: Yeah. I mean, look, there's no doubt that Hillary Clinton was a very strong candidate. She was qualified to serve as commander in chief. She was tough enough to withstand the kind of sustained attacks that the Republicans launched against her throughout the course of the entire campaign. She was prepared to take questions about Benghazi. She was prepared to take questions about her emails. And yet, despite all of that, it still wasn't enough. And I think the reason why is because even though there were plenty of flaws with her candidacy, the fact that she was running in 2016 meant that she was the heir apparent to the Democratic Party. Whereas nobody thought that Donald Trump was going to end up winning the Republican nomination in 2016. Everybody assumed that Jeb Bush was going to be the party's nominee. Or Marco Rubio, or Ted Cruz. And none of them were particularly well liked. And none of them were particularly well regarded. Certainly, none of them were seen as presidential material. Yet somehow Donald Trump emerged victorious in spite of all of those disadvantages. And he did so thanks largely to a combination of factors related to the overall state of the economy combined with his personal appeal, both to certain segments of the electorate, but also because of the sheer novelty of his candidacy.
And the fact that there weren't any previous examples for people to compare him to. Nobody had run a business empire before
### Assistant: Like that's the whole point, nobody had done it before.
### Human: Nobody had done it before. And nobody had done it with the amount of flamboyance that he brought to the table. Nobody had done it with the level of bombast that he exhibited. And nobody had done it with the level of braggadocio that he displayed. Nobody had ever suggested that they were a better negotiator than anyone else in the room, including their opponents. Nobody had ever boasted about their sexual exploits quite like Donald Trump had. Nobody had ever promised to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. Nobody had ever talked about banning Muslims from entering the country. All of those statements were new. All of those statements were shocking. All of those statements caused many people to recoil in horror. But others found them to be refreshingly direct and blunt. And they resonated with those folks. So there's no question that Donald Trump benefited from a number of unique circumstances. But even if you take away those unique circumstances, there were still plenty of other candidates who could have beaten him.
