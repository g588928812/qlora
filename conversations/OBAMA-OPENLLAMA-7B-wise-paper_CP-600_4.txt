### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump won the 2016 election? And how do we understand this moment in American history?
### Human: Well, I think it was a combination of a number of factors. I mean, one of them is just what we’ve discussed already which is the fact that there’s this realignment that’s going on between Republicans and Democrats and where people are feeling like their interests aren’t necessarily being taken care of by the political parties themselves. So if you have somebody who comes along and says they can make those things happen, even though maybe they don’t always follow through with what they say, you’re more likely to listen because at least they’re trying. But then there were also some specific dynamics around both him and Hillary Clinton. You know, she’d been a senator for New York for eight years; she’d had all these controversies during her time as secretary of state. He was an outsider. She hadn’t run in a while. She hadn’t done a lot of retail campaigning. The Republican National Committee and the campaign itself spent more than $5 billion dollars on television advertising and other forms of communication. And so when you’re looking at the actual electoral process, which is about getting out your vote, it doesn’t take much for someone to be able to eke out an advantage over another candidate. In addition, when you look at polling data, especially among white voters without college degrees, you see that there was a significant drop off between those who voted in 2012 and those who voted in 2
### Assistant: In 2016.
### Human: Right. So that’s why I believe he won. Because there were enough people who were saying, “You know what? Maybe this is somebody who understands us.”
### Assistant: So what does it mean to you personally that Donald Trump won? Do you think about this? Is it personal for you?
### Human: No, not particularly. It is interesting to watch the reaction to it, but it’s hard for me to relate to that.
### Assistant: I would imagine.
### Human: Yeah. There’s nothing personal about any of this stuff. It’s not really about me.
### Assistant: I guess my sense is this was an incredibly consequential event in American history. And maybe you could talk about that.
### Human: I would agree with that. I think it’s obviously been consequential. But again, none of this is personal for me.
