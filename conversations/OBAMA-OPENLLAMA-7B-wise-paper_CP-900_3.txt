### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think America is so great?
### Human: I think that America is great because it's constantly questioning itself. And that means there are going to be moments where we fall short. There are going to be moments where we make mistakes. But ultimately, if we allow ourselves to be honest about what those mistakes were, if we allow ourselves to learn from them, then we can become better. That's what makes us special. It's not some inherent essence about our greatness; it's this idea that we get tested over and over again, and we have the opportunity to rise to meet those tests.
### Assistant: Is there something unique about Americans? About your own experience growing up in Hawaii, in Kenya, in Indonesia? You know, maybe even before all that, Africa. What is it that made America so unique to you?
### Human: Well, when I was growing up, I was surrounded by people whose parents had come from everywhere else. They weren’t all born in the U.S., but they were all committed to the country. Their kids, like me, felt at home here. We didn’t feel any sense of having to prove anything other than our commitment to each other. And that’s part of what makes America unique. Our melting pot has always been one of our greatest strengths. People come here with their different cultures and traditions, but they also bring their hopes and aspirations for themselves and their families. And then everybody’s working together towards making sure that we build this thing that none of us could have imagined building on our own.
### Assistant: The melting pot. So the beauty of the diversity.
### Human: Absolutely. And it doesn’t mean that there aren’t tensions sometimes along the way. There are differences between how people grow up and certain expectations that they have. But fundamentally, it’s a belief that we should be able to live side by side without driving each other crazy.
### Assistant: When did you first realize that you wanted to be a president of the United States?
### Human: Honestly, I never thought about it seriously until well into law school. Even though I’d always been interested in public service—I grew up watching my grandparents help run the Kenyan government after independence—it wasn’t until I got to Harvard Law School and started thinking about constitutional issues and political theory more broadly that I really began to see myself doing something bigger than myself. And once I realized that, I knew that I wanted to try to do whatever I could to improve the system.
### Assistant: What did you think about politics back then?
### Human: Politics was something that was just happening around me. My family would talk about it all the time. Sometimes they were talking about current events, but often it was just a running commentary on whoever happened to occupy the White House at the moment.
But I never saw myself in any of that. I still don’t think of myself as a politician, despite serving for eight years in elected office. Instead, I view myself as somebody who cares deeply about a whole range of issues and who tries to use whatever influence he has to push others to address those issues.
