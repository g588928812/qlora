### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did Donald Trump win the 2016 election? You’ve written about this extensively. So let’s just start there because it seems like we have a lot to talk about.
### Human: Well, I think that’s the wrong question. It’s not the right question, but I will answer your question. The reason why Donald Trump won was that we had a deepening crisis of democracy in America at precisely the moment when a candidate could exploit those cracks and convince enough people that their grievances were real even if they didn't know exactly what to do about them. And so I wrote a book called “The Divider,” which talks about how our system has become more and more polarized and tribal since the 1970s. And so I would say it wasn't necessarily the case that Donald Trump won because he understood the concerns of working class voters better than Hillary Clinton. She might have done it herself. But she didn’t, obviously, but she could have. But the fact is that she also came across as kind of out of touch, especially during her debate performance against him. Because she spent most of her time trying to explain to the audience why he couldn't possibly be serious about building a wall between Mexico and the U.S., and he kept saying over and over again, “I will build a great big beautiful wall.” And then she said something like, “You can't keep immigrants out” and stuff like that. And it just seemed like she was completely tone deaf to some very basic realities. So that played a role. Also, many people felt that she was basically the continuation of George W. Bush
### Assistant: And she was the establishmentarian.
### Human: Right. She was the status quo ante. He promised to shake things up. That was another piece of it. Then the third piece was that the Democratic Party got taken off message by its own base. Bernie Sanders ran such a strong insurgency campaign against her within the primaries that they never really quite knew what to do after the primary ended. They didn't know whether they should go all in behind her or try to coalesce around somebody else. And meanwhile, Donald Trump was able to take advantage of the fact that many Democrats thought that he was unelectable. Even though he had a higher favorability rating among registered Republicans than Hillary Clinton did among registered Democrats. Many Democrats still thought that Republicans wouldn't vote for someone like him and independents would never vote for anyone who looked remotely Republican. So I don't want to pretend that it was one thing. There are lots of reasons why Donald Trump won. But the bottom line is that while he was a deeply flawed candidate, he did understand the anger and resentment that existed among a significant number of Americans. And he was able to tap into that in ways that Hillary Clinton simply failed to do.
### Assistant: Do you see any similarities between the rise of Donald Trump in 2016 versus the current situation of January 6th, 2021? Is there anything similar? What lessons does that teach us about where we are today as a country?
### Human: Well, I certainly see parallels in terms of the way that each man exploited the same underlying forces that have been at work in American politics for decades now. But I think the differences are much greater than the similarities. In 2016, nobody expected that Donald Trump would get elected president. Even though he started out leading in the polls early on, there was always a sense that there were too many obstacles in his path. And yet somehow he prevailed. Whereas today, anybody with eyes open knows that there’s no realistic scenario whereby Donald Trump wins reelection in November. Not only are the fundamentals different, the political context is fundamentally different. We’re talking about a sitting president who’s facing impeachment proceedings. We’re talking about a party that controls both houses of Congress. And therefore, unlike in 2016, Trump cannot count on Mitch McConnell alone to block all attempts to remove him from office. So whereas there was essentially zero chance of Trump winning the popular vote in 2016, I think there’s virtually zero chance of him winning the Electoral College in 2020.
### Assistant: Yeah. But isn’t there also differences in the level of support of these two men? Like if you look at the percentage of Americans who voted for each of them, is it comparable to the intensity of their supporters? Or does it feel very similar?
### Human: No, I mean, there’s definitely a difference between the level of support that each enjoyed relative to the other. Donald Trump was running against arguably the most qualified presidential nominee ever put forward by either major party. And he beat her in part because he managed to turn her perceived weaknesses into strengths. But despite all of that, Hillary Clinton actually won the national popular vote by almost three million votes. So I don’t think it’s fair to suggest that Trump benefited from a surge of new voters coming out in droves specifically to vote for him. Rather, what happened is that millions of people who previously hadn’t voted decided that they wanted to make sure that Trump didn’t get into the Oval Office. And they cast ballots in record numbers. And unfortunately, they didn’t trust Secretary Clinton enough to deliver them a victory.
### Assistant: So what are the key issues that motivated the supporters of Donald Trump back then? And what are the key issues that motivate supporters of Donald Trump today?
### Human: Well, I would say that the biggest issue dividing the electorate was trade policy. Donald Trump railed against China in particular for years before becoming a presidential candidate. And he convinced a whole bunch of blue collar workers throughout the Midwest, the Rust Belt states, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, etcetera, that he alone could restore America’s economic strength. And that was his argument throughout the primaries. And then once he became the presumptive nominee, he switched gears and began to argue that his main opponent was a woman whose husband left her high and dry when he went to China to sign NAFTA. Now, nobody believes that that’s true anymore. I mean, we’ve heard that story several times over the course of the past four decades. But nevertheless, that narrative stuck. It was effective. And even though Hillary Clinton ultimately prevailed in the end, it’s hard to dispute that Donald Trump was able to use his populist economic nationalism to successfully peel away enough white working class voters from the Democratic column to swing the election to him.
Nowadays, there are still plenty of legitimate complaints to be lodged against the outgoing administration’s trade policy. I’m not going to defend everything that Trump did in office. However, I do think that the overwhelming majority of Americans recognize that we need to diversify our trading relationships beyond just China. and that we shouldn’t be doing business with countries that abuse human rights and engage
