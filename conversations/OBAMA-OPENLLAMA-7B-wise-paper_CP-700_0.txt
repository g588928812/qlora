### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so many people love you? I think there's probably no other person that inspires such affection among Americans than yourself. So what can we learn about this country by understanding why it loves you?
### Human: Well, you know, it was interesting when I got out of office, because I hadn’t anticipated how emotional some people would be in their response. And I was just thinking about something else entirely when they were like, “Oh, Mr. President.” It didn’t register until afterwards, but what it meant is that over those eight years, whether people agreed with every decision that I had made or not, even if they disagreed with everything, they felt like they knew me; they knew that I cared about them; they felt invested in our national story as a whole; they saw themselves reflected in us; they understood me to have tried to make decisions based on things I thought would help the next generation, and then they could see themselves in that future. And maybe it was just because they liked me personally or perhaps they appreciated having somebody who seemed to share their values. But all these years later, people are still talking about those relationships they had developed with Michelle or myself, which is amazing.
### Assistant: That's why people get so emotional at your farewell address. The thing I noticed, though, is the way you connect with people, whether you're talking about your father or whether you're talking about yourself, it doesn't feel like you're sharing too much personal information. You seem to really connect through storytelling. What do you think makes up that connection?
### Human: I don't know what the magic formula is. Maybe it comes down to the fact that I grew up with parents who valued education and who believed that knowledge mattered. And so I always tried to take seriously the notion that I needed to understand where people came from and what their lives had been like before I could try to persuade them to go somewhere new or think differently. And so I guess part of what I learned growing up was the importance of empathy, listening, trying to put ourselves in someone else's shoes. Sometimes that might mean putting ourselves in the shoes of somebody who we fundamentally disagree with politically. Sometimes it might mean understanding the experience of somebody who comes from a different background than ours. And I also think that during the course of any presidency, particularly one that lasts for eight years, there are going to be a lot of experiences that are unique to that individual presidency. There are going to be events that nobody has ever seen before. And so the ability to tell stories about those events, to reflect back upon those events helps explain what happened, how did they happen, what should we learn from them. And hopefully that provides some context so that folks understand why certain decisions were made, what we hope will come out of them moving forward.
### Assistant: So the storytelling component of it. You mentioned Michelle, but there's also the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, whose memoir, Becoming, became a bestseller. Her husband called her the most important role model for young women of the past century. How does she inspire you?
### Human: She's extraordinary. We were together in the White House for eight years. We raised two daughters together. We went through so many experiences, good times and bad times. When she was running for president, she was dealing with unprecedented levels of misogyny and sexism. And yet she never lost sight of herself as a mom, as somebody who cares deeply about children, about families, about nutrition, about physical activity, about education. She took very seriously her responsibilities as a citizen. She never let anybody define her, but instead defined herself. And I think she showed everybody that regardless of your circumstances, regardless of your station, you can achieve anything you want to achieve. And that was tremendously inspiring. Not only for women, but men as well. As far as I'm concerned, she's still one of the most powerful women in the world, and she continues to work hard on behalf of kids everywhere.
### Assistant: Do you remember a specific moment from the presidency that changed you in unexpected ways? Or maybe a realization that came along with that?
### Human: Sure. One of the things that I found most fulfilling throughout my time in public life was getting to meet people around the country. Everywhere we traveled, whether it was for town halls or policy speeches or state dinners at Buckingham Palace, wherever we went, we always asked to visit schools. We wanted to hear directly from teachers and principals about what worked, what didn't work, what challenges they faced. Because ultimately, while we couldn't solve everyone's problems in Washington, we could listen to people and try to figure out solutions that we could implement both federally and locally. And I found that incredibly energizing. And I think that helped shape my approach after leaving office to say, okay, well, what are the issues that matter most to people right now? Where are the pockets of opportunity where we can actually bring communities together and find common ground on some basic priorities? Whether it was making sure we got more money into classrooms and expanding early childhood education; whether it was helping people access affordable health care without breaking the bank; whether it was trying to reduce gun violence; whether it was figuring out how we could lower the cost of prescription drugs. These are all big problems, but there were ways that we could chip away at them through executive action or legislation that would allow us to make real progress. And I continue to believe that that's the way you move America forward.
And then on top of that, I also realized pretty quickly that I loved interacting
### Assistant: with young people. And that there were so many bright minds coming up in America that were willing to speak truth to power, especially when it wasn't necessarily popular. They weren't afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. If we look back at the Obama administration, what do you think was its greatest accomplishment?
### Human: Oh gosh, it's hard to pick. Obviously, passing health care reform is something that I'll always be proud of, knowing that tens of millions of people who otherwise wouldn't have had insurance now do, that we brought costs down significantly for a whole range of families across the country. The stimulus package, even though it was criticized at the time as somehow wasteful spending and all these kinds of things, ended up saving millions of jobs and prevented the worst parts of the Great Recession from becoming a full-blown depression. Passing Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was another example. Nobody said it was perfect, but it tightened regulations on financial institutions that allowed us to avoid another Great Depression. And I think it sent a message globally that the days of recklessness when bankers could run wild were over. Those are three examples off the top of my head. There were others, but those stick out in my mind as things that we did that I'm very proud of.
When I left office, I wrote in my farewell address, quote, “I am heartbroken that over the past decade, the politics of division and resentment and paranoia have claimed the party of Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.” I said it then, and I've said it often since then. I regret that because I believe that the Republican Party used to stand for certain principles, including fiscal responsibility, limited government, free trade,
