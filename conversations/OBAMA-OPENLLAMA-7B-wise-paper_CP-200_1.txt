### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump became president?
### Human: I think it's hard to say. There are lots of theories about why he did so well among voters that weren’t necessarily supported by facts and evidence. You know, there was this idea that, “Oh, he spoke directly to these folks,” and that they were just upset because their jobs had been shipped overseas and everything else. That may be true, but if you look at the exit polling data, what happened is Donald Trump won white working class voters, which historically have voted Democratic. And yet, the Republican Party hadn't done much for those folks for decades. So I don't know how much credit you can give them for doing that. But I also think that there was something else happening. I think that people wanted change, they wanted somebody who said things differently than other politicians had been saying. They wanted someone who didn't seem like another Washington insider. They wanted somebody who looked different than everybody else. They liked his demeanor; they liked his tone; they liked his style. It wasn't just his words, although clearly he had some good ideas. He got elected based on those qualities, not because he articulated policy positions. I think part of what we learned during the campaign was that voters were willing to accept a lot of things in return for feeling good. They didn't care whether his policies would work or not.
### Assistant: The way he communicated made them feel good.
### Human: Made them feel good. Exactly. Even though when they thought more carefully about it, they realized, "Wait a second." They might say, “Well, wait a minute. We don't want him bombing Syria.” Or whatever the case may be. Maybe they wouldn't have agreed with all of his proposals, but they could see that he talked differently and acted differently than anyone else. And that appealed to voters. Now, does that mean he'll win again? Probably not. Because even though he still has supporters out there who will vote for him no matter what he says, he lost the popular vote. And the reason he lost the popular vote was because, while he was appealing to those voters in certain states, Hillary Clinton was able to appeal to enough voters in other parts of the country that she ended up winning the electoral college.
### Assistant: Yeah, but let me ask you something about that. If you're trying to understand what makes a successful candidate, what makes a person become president, is there anything that stands out? Do you remember any particular moment where you felt that Donald Trump had a chance to win? Where you knew that he was going to be the next president?
### Human: No, I never felt that way. In fact, after he announced his candidacy, I went to Iowa to campaign for our nominee, Secretary Clinton, because we knew that she needed every last vote she could get. And one of her top advisers asked me before I left D.C., “What should we tell Hillary?” What should we say to her?” I said, “Don’t worry too much about what’s happening in Iowa. She doesn’t need every single vote there. Don’t worry about New Hampshire either. Just go ahead and make sure that you’ve covered your bases in Nevada, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.” These are places where Hillary was expected to do well. And if she did well, then it would be unlikely that Donald Trump would win.
But what we found, instead, was that Donald Trump began to do better in rural areas of Iowa. And in the end, he beat us in Iowa by five percentage points. So I couldn't explain it. It seemed odd. At that point, there was this theory floating around that maybe it was due to the weather. That Iowa was unusually rainy at the time. And therefore, farmers who traditionally were Republicans were voting Democratic instead. I don't buy that explanation because I think the demographics of Iowa were pretty similar to the rest of the Midwest. But he still pulled off a surprise victory there. Afterwards, I was speaking with some Iowa Democrats who
### Assistant: And they still couldn't believe. Still couldn't believe. Right, yeah. Okay. Thank you.
### Human: And that was the beginning of it. Then he continued to pull off victories in subsequent contests. And we had no explanation for why that was occurring. It turned out that what was really happening is that Hillary Clinton was getting clobbered across rural America, particularly in small towns and rural communities. Whereas Donald Trump was performing strongly in rural counties. And it wasn't until later that we figured out exactly why that was the case. When it came to rural counties, people saw Donald Trump as representing the kind of economic populism that they themselves had long hoped to hear from politicians. When it came to urban centers, they saw Hillary Clinton as a creature of Wall Street. A creature of big banks and financial institutions, who had benefited from her husband's administration. And therefore, they concluded that she cared nothing about them.
Now, what was interesting is that Hillary Clinton had actually spent considerable time in those communities. She had gone to small towns across the Midwest to talk about issues important to them. She had visited factories and farms and ranches. But what she failed to recognize was that the very same attributes that made her attractive in those communities were precisely the reasons why many Americans were skeptical of her. They believed that she was a member of the elite establishment, that she was part of the political establishment. And so she failed to connect with ordinary citizens the way that Donald Trump did. And that's why he ultimately prevailed.
### Assistant: Did you sense that Hillary Clinton herself understood that disconnect?
### Human: Yes. In fact, one of the reasons why Hillary Clinton lost the election is because she underestimated the extent to which her opponent could exploit that divide. And this isn't unique to Donald Trump. Whenever there's a major cultural shift in society, the people who benefit from it tend to assume that everyone else sees it the same way that they do. They take for granted that their views are widely shared. They assume that everybody believes what they believe. So Hillary Clinton assumed that everyone in rural America felt the same way about trade deals and immigration and gun control and gay rights and women's rights and abortion and climate change. She assumed that everybody believed in those values. And when they proved to be incorrect assumptions, she paid the price for that failure.
