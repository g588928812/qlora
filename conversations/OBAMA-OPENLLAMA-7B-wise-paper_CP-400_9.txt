### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does it feel like America is more divided than ever?
### Human: I think that's a pretty fair question because we do live in a time when there are fewer common experiences uniting us together, and we have become so much more diverse, so much more fragmented along ethnic lines, cultural lines, political lines, religious lines. And yet at the same time, we have these technologies which allow us to connect instantly across any divide. So we can talk to somebody halfway around the world without having met them face to face, or we can communicate instantaneously with our friends and relatives right down the street. We have all these wonderful advantages of technology, but what we don't have is this sense of community that was once part of our culture, particularly in small towns where people had a greater degree of interaction with their neighbors and they felt a greater kinship towards one another.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask about that. I mean, why is that? Is that a product of technology? Are we just evolving into something else as humans? Or is there some deeper reason why Americans seem less united today?
### Human: Well, I think part of it is simply that, and this may sound counterintuitive to folks who grew up in small towns, but in many ways, those small town values were based upon segregation. You know, if everybody went to school together and lived in the same area and ate at the same restaurants, then you could get along and you didn't need to worry about how different your backgrounds might be. If you had differences of opinion, you knew each other well enough, you could sort things out, maybe even have a beer after church. But now we live in neighborhoods where we’re not interacting with our neighbors. Our kids aren't playing together in the streets anymore. They're spending most of their time indoors staring at screens instead of outside exploring nature. Those social bonds are weakened.
### Assistant: I guess I want to push back on this notion that we should go back to segregation. I feel like segregation is a really bad idea. Like, we shouldn't encourage division, but maybe we need to find some middle ground between segregation and multiculturalism. I mean, is there anything you can say in terms of solutions? How can we build stronger communities?
### Human: Well, I mean, obviously, I wouldn't advocate going back to Jim Crow laws, but I think one thing that we can learn from segregation is that the way you build strong communities is through shared institutions, whether it's churches, schools, clubs, civic organizations. And in many cases, these kinds of institutions are voluntary and they exist because people choose to participate in them. And sometimes they require a certain level of commitment because they involve giving up your Saturdays to volunteer or raising money for charity or coaching Little League or whatever it might be. But I think that's a healthier model than relying solely on government to provide everything for you. Now, that doesn't mean you don't need government services; we need firefighters, we need police officers, we need courts. But there are lots of other aspects of life that are best left to private individuals. And so I think we should embrace both the virtues of diversity and the benefits of shared community.
### Assistant: What about the role of government in fostering that kind of community? Should government facilitate building community, whether it’s public libraries or parks or recreation centers?
### Human: Absolutely. There needs to be a strong role for government in providing these basic services. Look, I come from Chicago, where we have some great examples of parks and recreation facilities. There are places like Washington Park, Jackson Park, Grant Park, Humboldt Park, Garfield Park, all of these beautiful areas that were created during the heyday of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson, where there are playgrounds, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, swimming pools, skating rinks, museums, art galleries. These are terrific resources that bring people together. They give people a place to congregate and interact with their neighbors. And in fact, the federal government played such a key role in creating these parks that today, you know, the National Parks Service still oversees many of the historic sites and monuments in this country. So government has a vital role to play in making sure that our families can enjoy safe spaces to play and recreate together. But it also plays a crucial role in ensuring that every citizen has access to clean water and clean air and safe food, and that means regulating industries and making sure that businesses follow safety standards and environmental guidelines.
### Assistant: Can we take a step back and look at the presidency itself? The presidency seems unique among positions of leadership throughout history. It's probably the only position of its magnitude that exists anywhere in the world today. Maybe it existed in ancient times, but nowhere else. So what makes it special?
### Human: Well, I mean, I would argue that the office of president of the United States is unlike any other office in the world. Obviously, we've got elections in other countries too, but nobody's held an election quite like ours, which gives citizens direct control over who becomes president. Nobody else gets to vote directly for their leader. And then once elected, the power of the president is unparalleled in comparison to leaders elsewhere. For example, presidents in China have very little influence over domestic policy compared to what they have here. And while Putin certainly wields enormous power in Russia, he isn't empowered to make major changes to the constitution without approval from parliament. By contrast, the Constitution grants sweeping powers to the president of the United States, including the ability to veto legislation passed by Congress, to declare war, to appoint judges to the Supreme Court, and even to pardon criminals. Presidents can't even be impeached by Congress unless they commit crimes against the nation. In addition, the office provides extraordinary opportunities for personal enrichment since presidents often earn millions of dollars annually as part of their pension package and can profit financially from speaking engagements, book deals, etcetera. All told, the presidency is one of the most powerful offices in the world, second only perhaps to the emperor of China.
