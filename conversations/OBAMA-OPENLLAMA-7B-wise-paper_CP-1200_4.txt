### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so many people still love you? You've left office over seven years ago. And yet there seems to be this deep affection, almost reverence towards you that I think only comes around maybe once every generation, if we look at it historically speaking. What do you make of that?
### Human: Well, first of all, thanks so much for having me back. It's great to see you again, man.
### Assistant: I know whereof you speak because I have the same experience wherever I go. Even when people disagree vehemently with everything you stand for, they somehow seem to love you anyway. I don't understand why. Maybe it means something good about America.
### Human: No, well, I mean, it probably does. If nothing else, I think it just reflects how high the bar was set in terms of what people expected out of their president. And then when somebody like myself came along, who had no Washington experience and was not a career politician, I think expectations were so low that even though my performance wasn't perfect, I got pretty decent marks overall. But yeah, look, I am very flattered. That's one of the nicer things about leaving public life is that unlike before, now nobody is trying to tell me what I should say anymore. So I can actually answer questions without worrying about whether or not someone will be mad at me.
### Assistant: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. There is some element of lowered expectations. I wonder if there's also something that happens after someone has been in office for four or eight years. After awhile, we get used to them and we stop seeing them as individuals and more as representatives of certain values.
### Human: Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, anybody who's been in elected office knows that the closer you are to the center of power, the more your every move is going to be analyzed through the lens of whatever you did yesterday. Whereas if you're a little further down the totem pole, then you can afford to take risks and experiment a bit more. Because ultimately if you screw up, you just end up getting demoted.
### Assistant: Right. Do you ever feel that pressure, like you said, the closer and closer you get to the center of power, especially during these times when everybody is watching closely, that you feel the weight of responsibility to do the right thing?
### Human: Oh sure, but I guess I never really bought into the notion of “the one.” I mean, throughout history, whenever somebody gets that level of power, sooner or later, they either abuse it or they become corrupted by it. And so I always thought that’s a huge mistake. I mean, the whole reason why our system of government is structured the way it is, is precisely because nobody person or small group of people should ever have that amount of unchecked power.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask you about another historical figure that’s often brought up as a comparison, which is Lincoln. In many ways, you guys share similar biographies. You both come from humble origins. You didn’t come to national prominence until you reached middle age. And you both became leaders at a time of crisis, during difficult and divisive periods in American history. How would you compare yourself to Abraham Lincoln?
Well, first of all, thank you for those kind words. I mean, obviously any compliment coming from you is music to my ears. Obviously, comparisons between ourselves and other historical figures are tricky business because inevitably, everyone is going to bring different experiences and baggage to the table when they try to make the comparison. For example, I’m sure most people listening to this podcast couldn’t pick me out of a lineup, whereas anyone who lived through the 2008 election could easily identify President Obama. On the other hand, however, I do think there are similarities between us, mainly our shared belief in the ideals that animated the abolitionist movement during Lincoln’s day. The fact that despite our differences, both of us ended up sitting in the Oval Office more than a century apart says volumes about the progress that America has made since the days of slavery.
However, I also want to point out that while we may share many of the same qualities, we also differ in important respects. Unlike me, Mr. Lincoln spent most of
### Human: Those are really interesting points you raise. I mean, one thing that sticks out in my mind is the fact that although we both hailed from humble backgrounds, my family background was by far the definition of “white trash” compared to his. Whereas his father was a successful storekeeper who married his wife because she was such a beautiful woman, mine was a simple country farmer who basically abandoned my mother when she gave birth to me. Whereas he went on to become one of the greatest lawyers of his era, I was a community organizer who nobody had ever heard of until he decided to run for political office. Whereas he rose to power largely because he was able to enlist the support of powerful Northerners like Ulysses S. Grant, I ascended to the White House because I managed to win three consecutive elections against some of the best political operatives in the world.
