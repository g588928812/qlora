### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does America matter? What makes this country special?
### Human: Well, it's a great place to ask that question because it's hard for any one person to answer something like that. It's obviously an incredibly diverse country. We have a long history, which means there are certain bedrock principles that we all believe in even if we don’t always agree about how they should be applied. And then we also have a young population compared to other countries around the world. So I think that when you put those things together, what makes this such a dynamic and exciting country is that anybody can come here and try their luck and they might make it big and they might fail but they're going to do so without having to give up their basic freedoms, right? Because we live in a society where people can speak their mind and practice their religion and assemble peacefully and so forth. They may not be able to get rich really quickly unless they work very hard at it. But nobody’s looking over your shoulder trying to figure out whether you’ve got AIDS or what’s in your bag or what color you are or whatever else happens to be fashionable these days.
### Assistant: Is there anything that stands out as particularly unique, positive or negative about the history of this nation that maybe you could tell us about the founding fathers or some of the key turning points throughout its history?
### Human: Yeah, well, look, I mean, I was just saying that nobody can lay claim to inventing America, right? That we are built on the backs of people who were already living here when our forebears showed up. And they didn’t all get along with each other either, and yet somehow through all kinds of travails, we still remain a beacon of hope and opportunity for people around the globe. You know, it wasn’t easy getting here; I mean, we fought a war against ourselves before we started fighting external enemies. But despite everything, I think we’ve always tried to live up to those values of freedom and openness and equality.
Now, during my lifetime, obviously we had a Jim Crow South and women couldn’t vote until 1920. We’d only just given them the right to serve in Congress and run for president back in 1976. We’ve gone a lot further since then, and sometimes that progress seems glacial, and sometimes it feels like it’s moving pretty fast. But every now and again, we’ll have somebody who will remind us why it matters that we keep working toward those goals. So think about Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on the bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Or think about Martin Luther King Jr., who gets shot down in Memphis while trying to support striking sanitation workers. And think about the three little girls blown up in the 16
### Assistant: Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama.
### Human: By members of the Ku Klux Klan.
### Assistant: All of these events leading up to the Civil Rights Movement, I guess what would you say, inspired Americans across the board to fight for equal rights for African Americans.
### Human: Absolutely, absolutely. Sometimes people forget that the civil rights movement was not just about black people and white people. It was about people of all races coming together. And we still haven’t fully realized the potential of that era, where suddenly people felt like America was more than just a bunch of laws on a piece of paper. They actually saw that the words “all men are created equal” meant something, and they wanted to act upon it.
### Assistant: What do you see as the role of government in helping to protect that beacon of light?
### Human: Well, first off, you gotta remember that the Framers of the Constitution were deeply skeptical of concentrated power, especially political power, which is why they came up with this system where different branches check and balance each other. So when it comes to issues involving civil rights, I think the most important thing that government can do is to enforce the law. If you’ve got a statute on the books that says discrimination based on race is illegal, then it ought to be enforced. Just imagine if instead of focusing on discrimination, we said, “Well, let’s wait and see whether people treat each other fairly.” Then we wouldn’t have the Voting Rights Act after 1870, because Black people weren’t allowed to vote. We wouldn’t have Social Security and Medicare. We wouldn’t have the Consumer Protection Agency. If you want to go to college, you can’t just show up on day one and expect to get admitted. There’s a process called affirmative action designed to make sure that historically disadvantaged groups aren’t shut out simply because of the color of their skin. So I think when it comes to civil rights, the role of government is to use the force of law to stamp out discrimination wherever it exists.
