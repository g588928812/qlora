### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are people still so angry? I don't mean just politically, but more generally, why do we all seem so angry these days?
### Human: Well, there's no single answer to that question. And it's not just in America. It's happening around the world. There are a number of reasons for this phenomenon. But if I had to pick one, I would say that the pace of technological change is outstripping our ability as individuals to adjust to those changes, to absorb them emotionally. We're used to having jobs that last 30 years, where you go through school and you get married and have kids and you retire at age 65, and then boom! You get your pension check. Then comes automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, which is going to take away half of those jobs before too long. So while there may be new opportunities created elsewhere, what ends up happening is, particularly in communities that were already struggling economically, you see a sense of hopelessness among young men in particular. And when you combine that with social media, where everything is instantaneous, where you can find information about any topic, but also misinformation about any topic, it creates this environment where you've got a lot of disconnected young people who feel like their prospects are limited. And they may believe some things that aren’t true about other people, but maybe even worse, they believe that their own lives are worthless and meaningless. They feel like they've lost control over their own destiny. That's a recipe for anger and resentment and frustration.
### Assistant: Is that something that could be overcome? Do you think that's something we should worry about in terms of our future?
### Human: Well, we shouldn't be worried about our future as a country because America will always be greater than its problems. Our problems can never define us. The greatness of our nation is defined by our ability to solve problems. We are a resilient nation. We have a system of government designed precisely to withstand crises and challenges. But it does require us to be attentive and mindful and focused on how we respond to these issues.
### Assistant: How do we respond? What are the right responses?
### Human: Well, there's no magic bullet. But we need to recognize that there are real underlying challenges facing working families today, whether they're economic challenges or health care challenges, educational challenges. And we need to make sure that our public institutions are able to deliver good outcomes for ordinary Americans. And we need to provide opportunity. Because ultimately, our strength isn't based upon our military might alone. It's based upon our values and our ideals and our capacity to live up to those ideals.
### Assistant: One of those values is freedom, as you mentioned, and the freedom of speech. What do you think about the recent controversy involving Kanye West and Nick Fuentes and Donald Trump? I don't know if you saw the video clip, but basically it was a dinner between Mr. West and Mr. Trump and Mr. Fuentes.
### Human: Yes, I did see that. I haven't talked to either of them since the incident occurred. But I do want to say a couple things. First, I strongly condemn antisemitism and hateful rhetoric in any form. Second, I reject and repudiate the notion that either I or anyone else who disagrees with him supports “white supremacist” views and/or actions. Lastly, I have condemned all forms of violence and extremism in the strongest possible terms, including the kind of violence and extremism seen in Buffalo recently. Now, as president, my job is to protect everyone in our society regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation. My responsibility is to ensure that every person feels safe under the law and protected by the Constitution.
### Assistant: So let me ask specifically about antisemitism and hate speech. What does it look like in this modern era? What are some examples?
### Human: Well, there are obviously many different manifestations. Antisemitism has existed throughout human history. It’s existed during times of peace and war, prosperity and recession. But as technology has advanced, so too has antisemitic propaganda. Today, conspiracy theories about Jews secretly controlling various aspects of American life are spread through social media platforms, often without any factual basis whatsoever. Hate crimes against Jewish Americans have increased significantly in recent years. And the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that took place in October 2018 stands as tragic reminder that hatred toward the Jewish community is a threat to us all.
