### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump won? And why did Hillary Clinton lose? I don't mean this rhetorically. I genuinely want to know what your thoughts are.
### Human: Well, I don’t really have a definitive answer because we were dealing with such an unusual election cycle. There was no precedent, obviously, for anything that had happened up until that point in our political life. We had never seen somebody run for president twice, never seen anybody run for president who had spent their whole career outside of elected office. So there wasn’t a model. In addition to that, we saw a lot of people voting against rather than for. It wasn’t simply a case where voters were saying “I like him,” or “I dislike her.” They were saying “This person doesn’t represent me.” And it turned out that some of those voters were Democrats, but they weren’t necessarily supporters of mine; they were supporters of Bernie Sanders. They voted against Hillary Clinton because they didn’t believe she would be able to deliver the change that they wanted to see. The fact that she hadn’t actually been involved in Democratic Party politics over the course of her career, and therefore couldn’t claim allegiance to any particular ideology within the party, meant that she ran into trouble with some folks even though she had a great deal of support among other Democrats.
### Assistant: How does one reconcile that with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote? If you look at the map, the blue areas are more populated and more liberal. How do you explain why Hillary Clinton lost in these key states? Is that something you can reconcile with the idea that she was just not liked by enough people?
### Human: No, I don’t think so. Look, I’m not going to pretend to be some expert on the electoral college. But my understanding is that if you win the Electoral College, which means winning the majority of the votes in individual states, then you win the presidency. That was true in both 2008 and 2012 when Barack and Michelle and Joe Biden and Jill Biden won the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. Now, the reason why Hillary Clinton lost the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote is partly due to the peculiarities of how electoral maps are drawn in certain parts of the country. For example, in Pennsylvania, where I grew up, rural counties tend to be Republican, whereas urban counties tend to be Democratic. Therefore, Hillary Clinton only got about 65% of the votes cast in Pennsylvania, while Trump received about 30%.
Now, if we assume that all Americans are equally represented under our Constitution, then you might argue that the Electoral College should have reflected the popular vote in Pennsylvania. However, because Pennsylvania is an urban state, Republicans are disadvantaged by the current system. That’s because rural Pennsylvanians get three electors for every voter in Philadelphia County, whereas Philadelphia gets none.
So while Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots, her Electoral College margin ended up being less than 2 million. And remember, Pennsylvania alone accounted for 66 electoral votes—
### Assistant: Just Pennsylvania? Yeah, yeah. That’s right. You could say that Pennsylvania accounts for half the popular vote difference between Clinton and Trump. Right. And Pennsylvania also represents the heart of coal country. And the coal industry is dying, and it’s been dying for decades.
You mentioned Joe Biden. What was it about Joe Biden that appealed to you so much? Was it his personality? Was it his experience?
### Human: Yes, it was his experience. Because the most important thing I knew about Joe Biden was that he had a long track record of fighting for working families. When Joe came back from World War II, he became an educator in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Then he went to Delaware and got elected to Congress. He fought for civil rights legislation and against apartheid in South Africa. Later, he worked to expand affordable healthcare coverage for seniors. After serving in the Senate, he became Vice President during the administration of President Obama. And I knew that Joe Biden was someone whose values aligned with mine.
### Assistant: Can you describe your friendship with Joe Biden? How did you develop that relationship?
### Human: Well, Joe and I met early in the presidential campaign when we flew together to Iowa to attend the Jefferson Jackson Dinner. And after that event, we decided to spend some time together. At the end of the night, we drove around Des Moines in his car, and Joe shared stories about growing up in Scranton. As I listened, I realized that Joe Biden had a very interesting background that I hadn’t known before. And we kept talking afterwards and struck up a friendship.
And then when the primary season began, Joe and I started spending more time together. Every morning, Joe would come to the White House and join us for breakfast. Sometimes, we’d watch movies together, or play basketball. And whenever we hung out, Joe always told me how proud he was of me, and how impressed he was with what I’d done. Those moments helped cement our friendship.
But even beyond that, Joe Biden reminded me of my dad. Both men were born in Scranton, and both went off to serve in the military. My father died when I was very young, but I remembered watching old home videos of him as a kid, listening to him tell funny stories about his days in the Navy. And I loved hearing Joe talk about his experiences growing up in Scranton. And I loved hearing him speak fondly about his family. Hearing these stories helped me feel closer to my father, and gave me a greater appreciation for Joe Biden’s
### Assistant: Your father’s name was Frank Obama Sr. And his parents were Ann Dunham and Barrack Hussein Obama Jr.
Their names are so beautiful. So you grew up around that kind of beauty in language, and that’s why you love poetry.
### Human: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
Yeah, that’s beautiful. Beautiful names. And I guess this brings me to another question. What do you think is the importance of language? How do you think about the power of language?
