### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected president? What's your analysis of that election, of his presidency? I know you didn’t vote for him. But let's talk about why people voted for him.
### Human: Yeah, thanks for having me on, Sam. So I actually have had some time now to reflect on this since he left office. And one thing I would say is that I don't want us to lose sight of the fact that there are real issues out there. That even though we may disagree on how to address them, there's no denying that there are genuine concerns, legitimate concerns about jobs, about trade agreements, about immigration, about wages. There are issues like climate change, which, although it didn't seem like a major issue during the campaign, is nonetheless something that's going to be important for our future. There are questions about national security. All of those things I think deserve to be debated seriously. The danger is when we get caught up in all of these divisions, not just among Democrats and Republicans but within parties as well, and we lose track of what it means to be an American; that we forget that we all care deeply about each other and that we share certain common values regardless of whether we agree on everything else.
### Assistant: It seems like that kind of commonality is lost on many Americans. They seem more concerned with identity than they are with principles. And if you look at America, maybe that's because of the diversity, the multiculturalism. If you take Europe, for example, Europe is less diverse. People tend to live around their own kind of community, so the culture tends to be more homogenous. In America, it seems to me that we're much more diverse. We can argue whether or not that's good or bad, but it seems like that's part of the problem. Because it makes it harder for people to identify with each other.
### Human: Well, I think there's some truth to that. One of the reasons I ran for president was because I thought we needed to find ways to bring people together rather than divide them further apart. And obviously, this wasn't a message that resonated with everyone. But I also believe that even the most partisan person still cares about America. I mean, even somebody who disagrees with me politically cares about this country. They might think that I'm doing too much of a particular policy. They might think that I haven't done enough. Maybe they think that I've gone too far. But they still believe in the idea of the United States as a place where anybody can make it if they work hard, that everybody should play by the same rules, and that nobody gets treated differently based on race or religion or gender or sexual orientation or any other characteristic. Those are core American beliefs. And so while people certainly have disagreements over specific policies, I always tried to remind folks that even though we were arguing about health insurance reform or immigration reform or trade, underneath all that there was still a shared belief in a set of ideals and a commitment to working together towards those ideals. And I think the challenge right now isn't just that the Republican Party has moved so far away from that vision. But I also think that Democrats have forgotten what that vision looks like. Instead of reminding ourselves of what binds us together, we spend too much time pointing out differences and emphas
### Assistant: Can I ask you about that? You mentioned immigration, trade. Is there anything you could point to specifically that divides the Democratic party and the Republican party?
### Human: Trade, I think, has become a dividing line. Even though historically trade has been bipartisan, in recent years, it's become more and more associated with the business interests of the Republican Party. And that's something that Democrats are increasingly reluctant to embrace. On immigration, we see that both parties are moving away from a bipartisan consensus that basically says that immigrants contribute to society. I think immigration has become a divisive issue, partly because of political polarization, partly because of the economic anxiety that many working class voters feel today.
### Assistant: When you said “political polarization,” are you talking about the politicians? Or are you talking about the citizens?
### Human: Both, I guess. Political polarization amongst elites. And then, of course, that trickles down to ordinary voters. I remember during the campaign in 2008, I was campaigning in Ohio. There were a lot of steelworkers who used to come into my town hall meetings, but now they weren’t coming because they couldn’t afford to come anymore. And instead of blaming the economy for the loss of jobs, they blamed Mexicans who were taking those jobs. And I think a big reason why that happened is because the debate about immigration had gotten so heated that it became a proxy for broader economic anxieties.
### Assistant: That's such an interesting perspective. And yet we can’t ignore that the Republican Party has chosen to embrace xenophobia in this case, which is unfortunate, I guess, to say.
Yes, absolutely.
### Human: Yes. Look, we shouldn't ignore that it exists, but we shouldn't let it define us either.
Right. That reminds me of the story about the two wolves inside of us. Which wolf wins? Do we choose to feed the wolf of hate or the wolf of love?
