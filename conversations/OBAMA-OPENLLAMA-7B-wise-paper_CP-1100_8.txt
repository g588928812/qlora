### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did America elect Donald Trump?
### Human: I think that we elected Donald Trump because we got frustrated after eight years of economic recovery under President [Barack] Obama, where incomes were going up for everybody except the people at the very top, but middle class families felt like their kids weren't doing as well as they had hoped; where people who have spent their entire lives believing themselves to be independent and not depending on anybody else suddenly found themselves having to go back on food stamps or Medicaid or some sort of welfare program. And so there was a real sense that things are not working and somebody needs to shake it up. Now, what folks don’t recognize is if you are shaking up Washington and you haven’t articulated any real plan for how exactly are you going to do this other than just saying “I’m gonna bring all these people together,” then those who are benefiting from the status quo and are invested in the way that Washington currently works and the special interests that benefit from it, they can make the case that your whole agenda is crazy and it’s gonna throw everything out of whack. That’s why I believe that the most important thing that I could do when I left office is to try to explain what it actually means to govern and how hard it is and how messy it gets and how much compromise you need and how difficult it is to get anything done. Because otherwise, people would say, “Oh yeah, he said he was gonna do something different. He didn’t do it
### Assistant: Well, let’s talk about that because you were, during your presidency, the man who could unite both sides of the aisle and still get stuff done. You’re now basically trying to explain to everyone that governing is tough, that it’s messy, it doesn’t always go according to plan. But I guess what I want to ask is whether or not you can see why Americans voted for Donald Trump despite all of that.
### Human: Absolutely. They were looking for somebody who promised to shake things up without offering them any kind of specifics about how exactly she was gonna do that. They also didn’t necessarily understand that even though it might sound appealing to think, “Wow, somebody who says they’re gonna come along and fix everything,” that’s never gonna happen unless you have buy-in from others. And so instead they were presented with a choice between the candidate whose whole career had been about getting things done and somebody whose whole career had been about promising to get things done without ever really delivering.
### Assistant: So maybe we should look into that further. How do you build support among the members of Congress, or better yet, how do you persuade members of Congress to actually work with each other and to work with you?
### Human: The short answer is sometimes it takes more time than you’ve got. Sometimes you gotta put yourself in the room and you gotta listen and you gotta earn their trust before they’ll do what you want them to do. And sometimes you gotta remind them of their own self interest rather than theirs versus yours. And sometimes you’ve gotta be willing to take a little bit less in order to get something big later down the road. There are certain times when you negotiate from strength and there are certain times when you negotiate from weakness. And the only thing worse than negotiating from weakness is pretending that you’re strong when you know that you’re weak. And so often what happens is folks will try to get you to agree to something that sounds good politically today, but tomorrow they’re gonna realize that either they’ve gotten nothing for it or that they’ve given away too much. So part of what you gotta do is to try to figure out where they’re coming from. What are their concerns? What are their priorities? Where do they wanna go over the long term? And then you gotta be able to match their current demands against your longer term vision for what you ultimately hope to accomplish. If you can’t do that, then you’re constantly playing a game of Whac-A-Mole and you’re never gonna get anything done.
### Assistant: Can you give examples? Maybe just one example of one or two items on which you tried to find common ground with Republicans.
### Human: Sure. Well, one of the biggest fights that I inherited when I came into office was this issue of so called Obamacare. This is what’s known formally as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It became law in 2010. Essentially, what it did was it gave states the option to set up insurance exchanges. If they wanted to, they could expand Medicaid. If they wanted to, they could partner with the federal government to run their own exchange. A number of states took advantage of this opportunity. Some did it through executive action. Others passed legislation. In Florida, Governor Rick Scott decided not to do it. He sued us in court to stop us from setting up an exchange. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled in our favor, and we ended up setting up an exchange. We also expanded Medicaid eligibility in Florida.
The idea behind it was simple. When the economy starts to recover after a major recession, it’s generally a smart idea for the government to step in and help people who have lost their jobs or who are worried about keeping their job because they may lose their employer provided health care coverage. And it was estimated that if you simply expanded Medicaid across the country, then you would cover around 5 million low income Americans who otherwise wouldn’t have access to affordable health care.
Now, when I came into office, I inherited about 30 million Americans without health insurance. By the end of my second term, that number had fallen
### Assistant: Wow!
### Human: To 28 million. Which again, when you compare that to the number of uninsured prior to the passage of Obamacare, that’s a pretty significant accomplishment. And it’s worth noting that millions of those folks were previously covered through SCHIP (State Children’s Health Insurance Program), which is a program that existed before Obamacare.
So there’s no doubt that Obamacare is imperfect, that we need to fix it, and we should continue to improve it. But what I objected to wasn’t the policy itself. It was the approach taken by opponents who insisted that they were fighting tooth and nail to repeal it even knowing full well that there was literally nobody in Congress who supported that position. including within their own party. So what they were doing was using this as a cudgel to beat Democrats over the head and saying, “We are so much better than these guys.” Meanwhile, they knew perfectly well that they couldn’t pass anything because they didn’t have the votes and they certainly didn’t have the support of the American public. So they were cynically using this as a political weapon. And what I argued during my campaign was that if you’re gonna tell voters you’re gonna fight for them, then you shouldn’t be using that as a pretext for taking positions that you know you can’t possibly implement because they’d just be lying to people if they pretended otherwise.
