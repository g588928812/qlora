### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won? What did he do right that Hillary Clinton didn't do wrong?

President Obama: I mean, it's funny, because I had just spoken to her yesterday. And she was saying, “I know this was your thing,” meaning, “You want to talk about it.” I said, “Well, it’d be good to have some distance before we dive into this.” But look, I think she ran a really strong campaign; I think she worked hard. I don’t fault her for anything other than what she knew would happen if she got nominated. Because Bernie Sanders was running as a populist candidate; Donald Trump was running as an outsider; Hillary Clinton was viewed as part of the establishment. She lost some of those folks. And so, you know, if she was going to win, she needed to expand beyond her base. And then she also wasn’t able to make the case to people that voted for Barack Obama twice, that voted for Bill Clinton, that voted for Ronald Reagan, that voted for Jimmy Carter—that there were ways that they could still be Democrats even though they weren’t sure they wanted to support a woman for president.
### Human: So what did she lose them? Was it too close to the establishment? Was it too close to the Clinton legacy?
### Assistant: Or was it the fact that they didn’t see herself as the leader of their party?
### Human: That was part of it. I think the perception was that she came across as kind of stiff, that she couldn’t connect with voters at the grassroots level. I think that’s something she learned during her time as Secretary of State when she was out campaigning around the world and talking to foreign leaders. It’s one thing to sit behind a desk at the State Department. It’s another thing to go into villages in Africa and ask farmers how much food they grow and listen to their concerns. The same thing goes for campaigning here. You can give speeches all day long and read off scripts. But when you’re actually out meeting voters, shaking hands, listening to their concerns and trying to answer questions honestly, you get a sense of whether or not you connect with voters and whether you’ve built up enough credibility over the years to take advantage of a moment like that. If you haven’t done that, then you’ll run into trouble.
### Assistant: How much of the Democratic Party is Hillary Clinton now?
### Human: Well, I think she still has a lot of supporters, but I think the party itself has changed significantly since she became the nominee. When she ran against Senator Obama, Senator Obama was perceived as a fresh face. He hadn’t been in Washington very long. He wasn’t a career politician. Hillary Clinton had spent decades in public service and was considered somewhat old school and somewhat stale. Whereas President Obama was young and energetic and new. Since then, both parties have seen shifts in demographics. Republicans saw a lot of gains among white working class voters, which traditionally had leaned Democratic. Democrats saw a lot of gains among minority voters, particularly Latinos. In addition to that, there’s been a shift away from rural areas and towards urban centers, especially cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee. Those are places where Democrats historically have struggled to compete with Republicans. All these things combined meant that Hillary Clinton was facing more competition from within her own party than Barack Obama faced in 2008.
The Democrats have been able to win elections under presidents named George Bush and Bill Clinton. They’ve been able to win elections under presidents named Obama and Clinton. However, they’ve never been able to win elections under presidents named Bush. So the idea that Hillary Clinton would be a stronger general election candidate than Barack Obama was always questionable. She didn’t come off as someone who inspired enthusiasm among the rank and file of her party.
### Assistant: Do you think she ran a bad campaign? Is it fair to say she ran a bad campaign?
### Human: I think it’s fair to say she made mistakes throughout the primary season. I think she was criticized for staying in Iowa too late after she had clinched the nomination. And I think she was criticized for coming off as arrogant at times. She seemed like she thought she was entitled to the presidency. She was used to being elected senator of New York, governor of New York, secretary of state, and then nominee for president. That’s not how most people enter politics. Most people start out lower down the ladder and work their way up gradually. She started out higher up the ladder. She assumed that her experience and connections would carry her through. Unfortunately, that’s not how campaigns work anymore. Nowadays, you need to demonstrate that you have a vision and energy and passion that inspires people. And I don’t think she demonstrated that enough.
### Assistant: Can you put yourself back in 2008? Barack Obama vs. Hillary Clinton. What advice would you give him?
### Human: At the end of the day, I think Barack Obama realized early on that Hillary Clinton represented the status quo. She represented a continuation of the Bush administration. She represented a continuation of the Clinton administration. While he believed strongly that she deserved credit for helping to improve the country while serving as First Lady, he understood that Americans were looking for somebody new. He was hoping to break with tradition and bring in fresh ideas and a new direction. Hillary Clinton didn’t represent any of that.
