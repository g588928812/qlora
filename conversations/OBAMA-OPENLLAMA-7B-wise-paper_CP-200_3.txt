### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Trump won? Why did he win the election? I know that you're not allowed to comment on politics anymore, but let me ask anyway.
### Human: You can make comments about the election because it was just over a year ago.
### Assistant: And we still have a president that's there. So why do you think that happened?
### Human: Well, I don't think it happened, you know, in any one particular way, although I will say, I mean, it wasn't a surprise. There were lots of indications along the way that Donald Trump had appeal among certain segments of the electorate. Some of those appeals were racial; some of them appealed to economic anxiety; others appealed to nostalgia. The fact that he ended up winning should not be surprising to anybody. But what I would emphasize is that when you look at the totality of the vote, there was no candidate running for either party who received more votes than Hillary Clinton did. And so while the Electoral College system has tended to distort things, it does reflect the popular vote. And if you add up all of the votes across the country, Hillary Clinton got almost three million votes more than Mr. Trump. She lost the election by about 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. If she had gotten 35% of those voters, she'd be president today. That said, the Republican Party also deserves credit for putting forward somebody like Mr. Trump, because they knew that he could mobilize their base in ways that nobody else could. And they also deserve credit for recognizing how toxic he was going to be for the broader electorate. They knew that he couldn't win in a general election. Their goal was to put forward somebody who could lose in a general election, which meant that they were willing to risk
### Assistant: Their own popularity and viability in order to win in the short term.
### Human: Right. But that's exactly right. That's why they didn't nominate Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney, if you remember, was viewed by many Republicans as too moderate. He didn't get enough votes to win Iowa. He didn’t get enough votes to win New Hampshire. He barely beat Rick Santorum in South Carolina. Then he ran up the score in Florida and Nevada. At that point, people started saying, “Okay, this guy might actually win.” And then he went into Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, where he lost. Now, if Mitt Romney hadn't run, somebody else would have come forward, probably Paul Ryan, who would have been a better nominee. But Republicans recognized that they needed somebody who could unite the conservative base without alienating independents. And Mr. Trump managed to do that.
### Assistant: I want to talk about Trump because I think there's something very interesting about him that makes him a fascinating character. But before we dive into him, what do you think the legacy of Barack Hussein Obama is?
### Human: Well, I hope that people will look back at my administration and say, yes, it may have been unconventional in terms of our approach to governing. We didn't try to ram through every idea that we had. Sometimes we failed miserably. Sometimes we succeeded spectacularly. It was messy. It was often contentious. But overall, I think we left behind an America that was stronger, fairer, and more prosperous than it was when we took office eight years ago.
### Assistant: And what do you think about your legacy? What do you think of yourself? How do you feel when you look back at your presidency?
### Human: Well, I don't think that I have done everything that I wanted to do during my time in office. And I don't think anybody ever does. But I am proud of the progress that we made and the changes that we effected in our country. But I always thought it was important to remind myself that, ultimately, the only thing that matters are the decisions that I make day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. And I take responsibility for whatever happens. And I also recognize that the impact that I had was limited compared to the impact that Congress had and the impact that governors had and mayors had and judges had and activists had, etc., etc. So I try to keep that perspective. But I'm proud of the work that we did.
