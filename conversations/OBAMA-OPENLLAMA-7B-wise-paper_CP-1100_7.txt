### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you run for president? And let's look at it historically. There hasn’t been a black man elected president before. I think there was like three white men (that) had been presidents before. So what were your motivations? What was going through your mind when you decided that this would be something worth doing?
### Human: Well, it wasn't just about electing a black guy. It was also because we hadn't really done anything particularly consequential since Franklin Roosevelt. We had not fundamentally changed how government works, if you think about it, in 50 years. Now, some of that was structural, right? You know, you get into these habits. The parties have their own power bases. They tend to be more interested in perpetuating themselves than they are in solving problems. But part of it too was simply that people felt as though the system itself was broken. That there weren't enough results anymore coming out of Washington DC. People didn't feel that they were getting any bang for their buck, even if they were still paying taxes. Even if they weren't necessarily directly experiencing the consequences of those taxes, they felt like somehow our political process was rigged against them. And so, I saw that, but I also saw that there was an opportunity to try to reassert, not only a belief that government could help people and that government mattered and that our country mattered, but also that you could actually make real progress on behalf of ordinary folks without resorting to all sorts of demagoguery. So the idea was not just to say, hey, look, America, we need to do better. We haven't been able to solve these big challenges. Here's why. But instead, let's find common ground, let'
### Assistant: But that seems impossible now.
### Human: No, no, nothing is impossible, especially when you've got young people like yourself, willing to roll up their sleeves and work hard. Nothing is impossible, but you gotta want to believe that that can happen.
### Assistant: But yeah, the cynicism level among Americans today is very high.
### Human: Yes, yes, absolutely.
### Assistant: But isn’t that what you were trying to combat?
### Human: Absolutely. And one of the things I said early on during the campaign was, “I don't promise that everything will be easy.” Because nobody ever does. “But I guarantee that everything will be possible.” If you give people hope that tomorrow can be different, then they are much more likely to go out and take on tough problems and work together across party lines to actually solve problems.
### Assistant: Yeah, but that's easier said than done. Especially after eight years of a former president who promised hope and change. So, yeah, we’re gonna dig into all of that stuff. But before we do, if we could take a little bit of a side road, and maybe answer questions that you might not expect. How about favorite books? You mentioned Dreams From My Father. Was there other great books along the way?
### Human: Oh, there's tons. I mean, I love reading. One book that probably had the most impact on me was a biography called Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln. written by Doris Kearns Goodwin. I read that shortly after starting law school back around ’88 or ’89. I remember vividly sitting in the library reading this book and thinking, oh my gosh, this is exactly why you go to law school. Because here's somebody who basically rose to the pinnacle of political power despite having differences with all of his colleagues. Despite the fact that at times, he was personally ambitious. At times, he didn't always share their vision. Yet somehow he brought everyone together, united behind a single purpose. And ultimately, it paid dividends. Not every decision that he made was the right decision, but the ones that he made were often informed by listening to others and sometimes changing course based upon new information.
