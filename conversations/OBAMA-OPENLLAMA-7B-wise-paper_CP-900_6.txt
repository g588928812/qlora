### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think you're the greatest president?
### Human: Well, that's not exactly what I want to talk about today. But since we live in an age where people are so self-referential and obsessed with trivia, I will say this: there have been presidents before me who were better than I was at certain things; there have been presidents after me who were better than I was at other things. In terms of foreign policy, I'm probably not going to rank myself very high. There’ve been some presidents that did more damage than I did; others who did less good than I did. But when it comes to managing the economy, I think I would probably be up there near the top. I inherited a mess when I came into office, but we were able to get unemployment down faster than any time in recorded history and create millions of jobs. And even though we didn't fix all our problems, we basically pulled us out of a very deep hole without creating another one. And I think those are things that future historians will look back on and say, “You know, they got us through tough times.” So if somebody said to me today, “Who's the best president?” I wouldn’t want to play favourites between Lincoln and Washington. FDR might come up because of World War II, but I also benefited enormously from the New Deal having grown up in Hawaii during the Depression. So I don't really want to answer your question until you give me the parameters. You've
### Assistant: given me the parameters.
### Human: But I want to ask you something else. If you were to ask historians 50 years from now, who do you think had the most positive impact on America over these last 50 years? It may well be Michelle and me and our family rather than just me individually. Because part of what we were trying to do was use the power of the White House as a platform to highlight issues around kids growing up in poverty and communities that have been neglected. Or how we treat veterans coming home from war, or the issue of climate change. These are not partisan concerns. They're not ideological questions. The science is pretty clear on all three of them. We can make progress if everybody's pulling together, but only if we have political leadership willing to step up and try to solve these problems. So maybe the measure ultimately isn't going to be whether I rank highly as compared to some past presidents. Maybe it should be whether, 50 years from now, the trajectory of the country is better off because of what we did than it otherwise would have been. And that's going to depend partly on the decisions that the next generation makes.
### Assistant: That's such a profound point. I mean, you could argue that the Obamas are the most important Americans in the last century or couple hundred years. Not because of their individual contributions themselves, but because of the example they set of using the presidency as a bully pulpit to elevate important issues facing society and using their own celebrity to shine light on them and bring people along and inspire action across different demographics.
### Human: Well, hopefully the story of our lives, including Michelle's life and our marriage and raising kids, will be seen as something that helps the nation move forward. But I suspect that even if we weren't here, there would still be a lot of work to do on the social justice front and on the environment and dealing with inequality. But it does help if you have somebody who occupies the Oval Office who not only cares about those issues, but can actually draw attention to them. And if we can't agree on every single issue, then we ought to at least be able to agree that these are worthwhile pursuits.
### Assistant: One of the interesting things about you is that you seem to genuinely care about people and have empathy towards people. How do you develop that? How do you become that person?
### Human: Well, I grew up believing in Jesus Christ and His teachings. And the central tenant of Christianity is to love thy neighbour as thyself. Now, that doesn't mean everybody loves everybody else. Sometimes people love people that they shouldn't. But you can't say you believe that principle and then walk away from it. And certainly nobody's perfect. Nobody is sinless. I've sinned my way through life. But the notion that somehow if you're religious, you need to check your faith at the door when you enter public life – that betrays both religion and politics. What I tried to do throughout my presidency was to practise that precept of loving thy neighbour as thyself. And sometimes it meant reaching out to someone I profoundly disagreed with politically or culturally or racially or whatever. Other times it meant making sure that I was showing sensitivity towards someone whose background might be different from mine. And other times it meant making sure that I was looking out for folks who don't always get looked out for, like young children or the elderly or working families. Those were the kinds of values that animated my approach to governing. And I hope that those values continue to inform whoever the next president is and whoever serves in Congress.
### Assistant: Is there anything you wish you had done differently in either your early life or later life? Any regrets?
### Human: No. I think the arc of my career has been one that's brought me enormous satisfaction. I feel very lucky that I got to spend four decades in service to my country. And while I don't claim to have gotten everything right, I think that overall I ended up leaving the world a little bit better than I found it.
