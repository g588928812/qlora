### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think there are so few black people in positions of power today?
### Human: Well, I don't know if it's so few relative to their numbers in the population. You just look at Fortune 500 CEOs, they’re mostly white males. They've historically been more likely to be from similar backgrounds. But what we have seen is that over time there are more and more people of color who are making it into these upper echelons of business, of medicine, of law, of science, etcetera. So, yes, we should always ask ourselves why there aren't more blacks in charge. That would be true even if we had proportional representation among different groups. But what we see is more than proportional representation when it comes to some of our most important industries.
### Assistant: And then maybe a follow up question. What about women in those same fields?
### Human: Women too. We still have a ways to go but we’re seeing more and more women CEOS and other top executives.
### Assistant: And one of them is your wife Michelle Obama.
### Human: Yes. She’s somebody whose background is very unusual in many ways because she didn't come out of the usual prep schools and elite universities. Instead, she came from the South Side of Chicago where her parents were both working class folks. Her father was a pump operator for the city of Chicago, her mother a secretary. And yet, she rose to become the First Lady of the United States, a Princeton and Harvard Law gradate.
### Assistant: Do you have any thoughts on why there hasn’t been another woman president of the United States?
### Human: No, not really. I mean, obviously, there are many qualified women who could be elected president. I suspect that this will happen eventually. It may take longer than men waited before the first man became president, but we'll get there.
### Assistant: What about the topic of police brutality against unarmed black people? There's been a lot of media attention recently. What is the solution to this problem?
### Human: The best way to solve this problem is to make sure that everyone understands how to work together and treat each other with respect. And unfortunately, sometimes we have situations where young African Americans feel like they’re targeted unfairly by the police, and sometimes they're right. But we also have a situation where sometimes police officers are put in impossible situations and they end up having to use force which tragically results in death or injury. Sometimes they feel that they’re being vilified when they did everything that they were supposed to do. So part of it is to try to educate everybody. And fortunately, we now have technology which allows us to hear what people are saying during these incidents. So we can get all the facts and understand exactly what happened. But ultimately, we need to make sure that we have a sense of mutual understanding between law enforcement officials and members of minority communities. If we can find those solutions, then we’d probably be better off than we are today.
