### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won? You’ve talked about how it was surprising. What did you find surprising about the outcome? I know you don't want to speak ill of the dead, but what are your reflections on the election itself?
### Human: So when we were campaigning in Iowa last year, I remember saying this would be the most consequential campaign because we had such stark differences between the candidates. And that was true. And we also knew going into it that Hillary Clinton would have advantages over Mr. Trump. She'd done more fundraising than him, she had a lot more support from Democrats around the country. Republicans weren't enthusiastic about her candidacy, but they weren't hostile either. They weren't thinking about throwing their vote away.
They thought there might be somebody else better, but they didn't think there was anybody worse. But then we went out to Iowa and I said if we win Iowa, we’re gonna win the White House. And at the time, I really believed that. Because I knew that there wasn’t anything else out there where you could say, “Oh, well, this candidate can’t possibly beat Hillary Clinton.” We couldn’t take any votes for granted. So if we won Iowa, we would be able to go through New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin. If we kept winning those states, then we were gonna put ourselves in position to win. And so I felt very confident that if we could pull off Iowa, we were gonna win. And Iowa turned out to be closer than it should have been. And so it took longer than it should have. It wasn't a landslide victory
### Assistant: Well, I mean, it wasn't like Ohio and Florida.
### Human: No, no, no. But the point is, we weren't just hoping against hope that something unexpected happened. I knew we had a chance, but I also knew there were enough things that we needed to get right to ensure that our message was compelling. That our ideas resonated with people. Our strategy worked.
The polls were wrong. The polling was wrong, which doesn’t happen often, but it happens sometimes. Polls underestimated turnout among minority voters. Pollsters overestimated Republican enthusiasm for their nominee. Pollsters overestimated Republican enthusiasm for their nominee. Pollsters underestimated Democratic turnout. And that was because a number of factors played into that. One was the fact that we had spent months going around the country talking to working class folks who hadn't voted since Reagan, and explaining why the world was changing. We explained that we weren't just offering nostalgia, we were proposing solutions. And when you're doing that, you inspire people to come out and vote.
So even though we knew that Republicans weren't enthusiastic, even though Republicans weren't enthusiastic, even though Republicans weren't enthusiastic, we still managed to outperform expectations. And it wasn't enough. We lost. And that was painful. And it hurt us for a while. But I believe that if we'd won Iowa and we'd won New Hampshire, then we’d have gone on to win other places. Now, that’
### Assistant: That’s interesting. So let me ask you a followup question on that. So what do you attribute the strength of the Republican Party and what do you attribute their ability to mobilize voters? What is the source of their strength?
### Human: Oh, gosh. You know, it was fascinating to watch that play out because, you know, you look back historically and the reason why Republicans tend to be stronger is because their base tends to be older, whiter, less educated, rural. And that is a constituency that has traditionally gotten more energized during presidential elections. Now, one thing that changed during the course of this campaign is that white men without college degrees actually broke for Hillary Clinton. So it was not only minorities, young people, urbanites, suburbanites. Women, by the way, came out in record numbers to support Hillary Clinton. And the reason they came out is because they saw themselves in Mrs. Clinton. Her husband represented the old ways of doing business, the old rules, and she offered them a fresh start.
And so Republicans were concerned about whether they could keep these groups together. They worried that maybe some of these constituencies would split and go third party or stay home rather than voting for the nominee. And in many cases, they were proven right. In Pennsylvania, for example, we lost women by six points; we lost whites without college degrees by seven points. Younger voters went overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. College graduates went overwhelmingly for Mrs. Clinton. Urban dwellers went overwhelmingly for Mrs. Clinton. Suburbanites went overwhelmingly for Mrs. Clinton. And yet somehow Mr. Trump ended up winning. And part of that is because Republicans were able to turn out their base in rural areas
### Assistant: That's a great analysis. Thank you. Can you give us a sense of how much of a role identity plays? So in terms of the demographics of the electorate, who do you think is responsible for bringing America to its current place politically? Is it identity? Is it policy? Is it race relations? Is it gender equality? Is it immigration issues? Who do you think is responsible for bringing America to this place politically?
### Human: I’m not sure that there’s a simple answer to that. There’s obviously a lot that goes into it. Obviously the economy matters a lot. Obviously foreign policy matters a lot. Obviously race relations matter a lot. Immigration matters a lot. But there is a deeper level underneath all that. There’s a cultural divide between blue collar workers and professionals. And I think that was something that was evident during the primaries and that continued throughout the general election. When you looked at some of the rallies that Mr. Trump held, you got a sense of that. People didn’t feel like they belonged. They felt excluded. They felt left behind. And that helped explain why Mr. Trump won some of those communities.
### Assistant: I think identity is important too. How much is identity politics involved in the election?
### Human: Identity politics is an issue, but it's not the primary factor. I think that there's a cultural divide between blue collar workers and professionals. And I think that was evident during the primary and that continued throughout the general election. When you looked at some of the rallies that Mr. Trump held, you got a sense of that. People didn’t feel like they belonged. They felt excluded. They felt left behind. And that helped explain why Mr. Trump won some of those communities.
I think there’s always been a strain of populism in America, and that’s been exacerbated now that technology has disrupted entire industries and jobs that used to sustain middle class families are now being eliminated. And so there is a sense that the deck is stacked against ordinary Americans. And I think that’s part of the explanation. I also think that the Republican Party has embraced this view that government shouldn’t interfere with markets, even when markets aren’t functioning properly. Markets work best when everyone has access to opportunity, education, good health care. Government does need to intervene, but conservatives have tended to resist those interventions, which means that the gap grows wider. And so you end up having a situation where you have a lot of angry people feeling disenfranchised. And they’ll turn to anyone who tells them, “You’re not alone. I understand you. I sympathize with you,” and that person will exploit their anger.
