### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are Americans so angry?

President Obama: Well, I don't think they're all that angry. There's certainly a subset of people that feel disenfranchised. They feel like their interests aren't represented. Somebody told me once, “You know, if you’ve got a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” And there are a lot of issues that are important and that deserve attention, but they don't have a hammer, and that makes it easy to ignore those problems. So what you see are folks who feel left out and disconnected. Then you get politicians who want to capitalize off of that anger because they can say, “Well, we need to protect America,” when really they just want power. And then you get voters who go along with it. But I do think that there is this sense among some citizens that the system is not working for them. It feels rigged against them. We saw evidence of that during the election campaign itself. The idea that somebody could run for president without ever having held elected office before, or without any experience whatsoever, was hard for many Americans to accept.
And even though Donald Trump didn't win the popular vote, he won the electoral college vote, which is what determines our presidents. That sends a signal about whether elections matter anymore. Do candidates care more about winning than serving the country? What happens in Washington matters. When Congress doesn't act to raise
### Human: wages, when Congress fails to protect consumers, when they fail to invest in infrastructure, that hurts ordinary Americans. That undermines the trust that ordinary Americans have in government and their capacity to participate in democracy. Now, part of the reason why I ran was precisely because I felt like the institutions weren't working the way they should be. You had gridlock in Congress, where Republicans and Democrats couldn't agree on anything. Even something like raising the minimum wage, which everybody supported, couldn't pass. And yet, you'd still have Republican governors raising the minimum wage in their states. If you were a young person working at McDonald's making $8 an hour, you were getting paid less than your parents had gotten paid working at McDonald's. So I thought, wait a second, these folks aren't looking out for us. So part of what I tried to do as president was restore faith in government, restore faith in the process. And you know, I think it helped elect some Democratic senators and representatives, but I also think that it helped Democrats hold onto Congress in 2016. Because if you believe that things are unfair, that politicians aren't representing your interests, then you're going to sit back and watch what happens instead of voting. And so I think one of the reasons why, for example, Obamacare passed — well, Obamacare didn't actually pass. It passed by reconciliation through the Senate after Mitch McConnell refused to allow
### Assistant: To negotiate with him and work together.
President Obama: Yeah. He wouldn't give Democrats a seat at the table. In fact, I think what happened is he wanted to make sure that it failed. And then we had this ridiculous spectacle where Ted Cruz went up on the floor and said, “I will personally filibuster” — meaning block its passage — “for as long as I possibly can. You can vote no, but I promise you I am going to fight tooth and nail to prevent this bill from passing.” So he basically guaranteed that it would never pass. And I said, “Wait a minute. If you're gonna filibuster, let's get into a debate.” And I remember saying, “Why don't you tell me exactly how much money I saved taxpayers?” (laughing) You know, Ted Cruz was promising to save taxpayers billions, billions of dollars. Well, here's what I did. I lowered Medicare premiums for seniors by $700 billion over ten years. And that's more savings to Medicare beneficiaries than Ted Cruz promised to save taxpayers. And I didn't do it by threatening to shut down the government. I didn't do it by refusing to negotiate. I simply negotiated. And we came to agreement with the other side. And then we got Democrats in the House and the Senate to vote for it. Now, that's not to suggest that Republicans haven't offered legitimate criticisms
### Human: about Obamacare. I mean, they have legitimate criticisms, but they refuse to acknowledge the successes. They refuse to acknowledge the benefits that millions of Americans have received.
President Obama: Right. And you know, they'll point to anecdotes. Like, look, somebody lost coverage because they lost their job. That's true. Everybody loses coverage when they lose their job. That's life. You lose coverage when you graduate from high school. Nobody thinks that's fair. That doesn't justify throwing up your hands and saying, “Let's just repeal it.” And then what happens? People suffer. And what happens to the economy? What happens to employers? You know, small businesses and large businesses alike are affected. And so the notion that we're somehow better off with fewer Americans covered is absurd.
### Assistant: What does that say about the state of our society when you have a political party that refuses to acknowledge positive outcomes because they don't fit into their ideological narrative?
### Human: Exactly. And again, I don't blame the average voter. They're trying to navigate a complicated world. And I think sometimes they're influenced by rhetoric. But ultimately, it's incumbent upon leaders to provide clarity and truthfulness about what's happening.
When you were President Obama, did you feel that you understood the American psyche and what drives its discontents? Did you understand that frustration and anger?
### Assistant: What does understanding mean? I guess I'm curious about, you know, what is the American psyche? Is it different than the Canadian psyche? Are Canadians angry? Is Canada unhappy?
### Human: Well, I think the nature of politics is similar across North America. There's a tendency towards polarization, a tendency towards tribalism. And there are certain issues that become sort of rallying cries for particular tribes, particularly social media. One thing that surprised me coming from Chicago to Washington is how partisan everything became, and how tribal everything became. It used to be, if you worked in City Hall, you knew everybody regardless of party affiliation. You'd shake hands with Mayor Daley and Mayor Richard M. Daley and Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Mayor Lori Lightfoot. There was this kind of cross-party cooperation and collaboration. Not so much now. And I think that creates a challenge for our public officials because if they try to reach across parties, it means they're not playing to their base, and their base wants to play to their tribe.
President Obama: Well, I think the difference between Chicago and Washington is that Chicago is a city that’s built around neighborhoods. So it's easier to cross the aisle in Chicago than in Washington because people live close enough to each other that they interact. Whereas in Washington, there may be a congressperson whose district covers rural areas and suburbs. And urban centers, suburban areas, etc., and that person might represent hundreds of thousands of constituents. And so it becomes harder for them to relate to those individuals. But I do think that you’re right that we see more polarization today. Partly
### Assistant: Because it's easier to communicate online than it is offline? It's faster.
### Human: Yes. Social media amplifies tribalism. But also I think people are tired of hearing politicians talk past each other. They’re tired of hearing politicians just yell at each other. They want to hear solutions, and they want to hear people talking about ways that they can get ahead economically, and they want to hear politicians talking about education and infrastructure and health care. Those are all issues that affect everyday lives. But I think we’ve gone through several cycles where politicians seem unable to come together and find common ground and compromise. And the result is that people are cynical about government.
