### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election?
### Human: I'm going to give you a very honest answer that may not be politically correct because it’s important for people to understand why we ended up where we are today. The reason that Mr. Trump was able to win despite his manifest unfitness for office was that there were millions of Americans who voted for him while knowing that he wasn’t fit for office. They did so either because they didn’t care about what he said or what he tweeted or whether he would tell lies every day, or they genuinely believed that he would somehow make America great again. And those people felt left behind economically. They had lost their jobs in part because of automation and globalization and didn’t feel like anybody was listening to them. And they saw this billionaire businessman who was gonna shake things up and do something different. Now, having said all that, if I had to guess what might have happened differently, If somebody like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or John Kasich had gotten elected instead of Donald Trump, even though they weren’t exactly inspiring, at least they seemed more likely than Mr. Trump to surround themselves with competent people and actually govern effectively.
### Assistant: But isn’t that still an issue of character?
### Human: No doubt. It’s an issue of character. Character matters. That’s why I wrote two books about it. So yes, character mattered. But these other candidates also didn’t go around saying whatever pops into their head and then doubling down when they get called out on stuff. You know, there’s a real difference between making mistakes and changing your mind versus just lying about stuff over and over and then denying when confronted with evidence that you’ve lied. There’s a big difference between someone who says mean things about immigrants but then goes to visit a detention center and listens to the conditions inside and ends up feeling bad about himself afterwards, versus someone whose whole worldview is based on hate.
### Assistant: What do you think is the biggest mistake that Hillary Clinton made during her campaign against Donald Trump?
### Human: Well, there were several mistakes, but one of them was that she thought she could take him seriously as a candidate and therefore needed to treat him as a serious opponent rather than the joke that he was. And so she adopted some of his positions herself. She went after his core supporters, she talked about building walls, she gave a speech in which she basically said that she was going to put coal miners out of work. So it’s not surprising that those people decided to vote for him instead of her. If you want to beat somebody like that, you shouldn’t try to outdo them. Just simply say, “I’m better than you.” Beat them soundly.
### Assistant: Okay, let’s talk briefly about Russia and Vladimir Putin. He’s arguably the most powerful man in the world. In your new book, A Promised Land, you write that you believe Putin wanted to undermine confidence in our democracy. To what extent does his actions contribute to the sense of distrust that exists among Americans?
### Human: Well, I don’t think that his actions alone explain it. But they certainly didn’t help. Because even before the Russian interference, we already had a pretty strong anti-Russian bias. We’d just finished eight years under a president who spent most of his time obsessing about the evils of Russia and trying to build a wall between us and Mexico. So when we got hit with this barrage of Russian propaganda during the campaign, it probably reinforced people’s existing views.
### Assistant: Is there anything positive that can come from the fact that so much of our government officials now believe Vladimir Putin? Does it make us stronger? Does it make us weaker?
### Human: I think it makes us weaker because it means that we’re giving way too much credence to a foreign leader.
