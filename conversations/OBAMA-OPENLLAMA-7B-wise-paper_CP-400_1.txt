### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you believe that Donald Trump was elected? You have described him as “a symptom rather than the cause.” What did you mean by that?
### Human: Well, I think there’s a couple reasons why I said that. The main one is that I’m not a political scientist. I don’t claim to be able to analyze all of this stuff. I’ve got some opinions about it, but I’m no expert. But what I will say is I am someone who believes deeply in democracy. And I’m someone who has studied politics and political trends for a long time. So when we get into these questions about what happened in the election and why people voted the way they did, I’ll just say candidly, it’s hard for me to analyze because I haven’t done enough study to understand everything. I know that’s a cop out answer. But I guess what I would say is that I don’t really have any great insights into why he won. I think it had something to do with the fact that the Democratic Party wasn’t offering a vision that people believed in. It had to do with a lot of factors outside our control that I can’t really explain without doing more research.
### Assistant: Do you see the election of Trump as part of a larger historical trend toward authoritarianism? That’s another way of putting your response. Is this like Hitler coming to power? Or is this just one person with a temperament that doesn't fit within democratic norms, which then leads to the rise of dictatorships?
### Human: I think if you look at the last few decades, there are plenty of examples around the world where you have leaders coming to power who are not democratically elected, and who either end up ruling through their own personal authority, or they rule through a party apparatus that may not reflect the views of everyone in society. There’s also a tendency for democracies to break down over time. Sometimes that happens peacefully, sometimes that happens violently. When people talk about whether America might turn into a dictatorship, I always caution against exaggerating how close we are to that. Because ultimately, if you want to live in a free country, you need to participate in it and make sure that it remains free.
So the reason I hesitate to describe Mr. Trump’s leadership style as an example of authoritarianism, although it’s certainly authoritarian in terms of its methods, is because it is important for us to remember that democracy isn’t something that’s handed to us. We need to work to maintain it. If you look back historically at countries where democracy didn’t survive for very long, often times what happened is that the populace became complacent and stopped participating. They assumed that things were going to remain the same, so they stopped engaging politically and letting their voices be heard. And I worry that that could happen here too. So while I agree that the current president has many traits that resemble those of past dictators, I wouldn’t describe him as a dictator
### Assistant: Well, let me ask you a question about this. What does it take to be a good leader, especially today, during these turbulent times?
### Human: For me personally, I think being a good leader means understanding that the most important job of a leader is to help unite the American people behind common goals and values. A leader needs to inspire and motivate people. In order to do that effectively, a leader needs to listen to the concerns and aspirations of others. He or she needs to bring diverse viewpoints together. And above all else, a leader needs to embody a sense of humility and modesty. A true leader should never consider themselves better or smarter than anyone else. Instead, they should strive to serve the interests of the nation as a whole. As we saw during my administration, I worked very hard to try to ensure that every voice was heard and respected, regardless of whether or not you agreed with them or supported my agenda. I tried to govern with respect and dignity and avoid unnecessary conflict whenever possible. These qualities are essential for building trust among citizens and ensuring that we move forward together towards shared objectives. Ultimately, leading successfully requires more than just having good ideas; it also involves communicating them clearly and persuasively to others. By combining knowledge with empathy, courage, and wisdom, effective leaders can steer nations through difficult periods and chart a course toward brighter futures.
### Assistant: One of the ways you’re able to do that, perhaps the best example, was your ability to communicate with the American public. Can you speak to this idea of communication? How do you become a good communicator?
### Human: Communication is one of the most crucial aspects of leadership. Without effective communication skills, a leader cannot hope to succeed. Effective communication starts with listening carefully to the concerns of others and responding thoughtfully to their perspectives. It also includes using language that is clear and concise, avoiding jargon or flowery prose. Finally, effective communication requires establishing credibility through actions rather than words alone. To do this, a leader must demonstrate honesty and integrity by adhering to principles even when faced with adversity or criticism. Only then can they gain the trust necessary to lead effectively.

I’m convinced that the best way to learn how to communicate effectively is through experience. Over the years, I’ve found that it’s helpful to practice giving speeches, interviews, or presentations before an audience. Doing so allows you to hear feedback directly from listeners and identify areas where you can improve your delivery. Additionally
### Assistant: What advice would you give young men and women who are interested in entering politics? They want to run for office. They want to get involved in politics. They want to change the world. What advice would you give them?
### Human: First off, I would encourage anyone considering running for office to do their homework. Politics is complex and there’s a lot to learn. Make sure you fully understand the issues facing your community before making a decision about whether or not to enter politics. Additionally, I would advise aspiring politicians to seek advice from experienced mentors who can offer guidance based on their experiences in the field. Finally, I would urge prospective candidates to keep an open mind throughout the campaign process and stay focused on serving the needs of constituents rather than worrying about winning votes or securing endorsements from special interest groups. Allowing yourself to be influenced solely by self-interest instead of the greater good may result in poor decisions down the road once you assume office.

If you decide to enter politics, remember that it’s not all glamorous. Many days will involve tedious tasks such as attending meetings or writing letters to constituents. However, these responsibilities are vital components of the job description for anyone seeking elected office. Be prepared to put in the hours required to ensure success on Election Day!
