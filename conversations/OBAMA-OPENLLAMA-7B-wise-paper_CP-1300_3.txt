### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we need government?
### Human: Well, I think that there are some things that we can't do ourselves collectively because they either require us acting as one nation across multiple states or simply it’s not economically feasible for individuals to do them unless we pool our resources. So education is probably the best example of something where if left up to individuals, it doesn't make sense for everybody individually to go through years of school. It makes sense for somebody who wants to be a doctor, but nobody else would choose to do so because it costs tens of thousands of dollars per year. But collectively as a society, we spend billions upon billions of dollars on K through 12 education, and then even more money to send people to college. That’s why we have public universities. And so the idea that somehow those systems don’t work is belied by the fact that we all use them every day. Roads, bridges, sewer systems, national parks, libraries, these are all examples of things that most Americans take for granted that wouldn’t work without government. They certainly wouldn’t happen without private sector activity, but they could never get done without government.
And what’s also interesting about this is that whether you’re talking about building roads and bridges, which is obviously a very tangible thing, but when it comes to things like scientific research, technological innovation, early childhood education, figuring out how to transition to a clean energy economy, any number of other things, sometimes it’s hard to
### Assistant: Is there anything about those activities of government that should be left to government versus to the market? Or maybe the better way to ask that is, what's your vision of the proper size of government in America today?
### Human: Well, so let's talk about size. The key test isn't necessarily the size of government; it’s how well does government serve its citizens? If you look at our history, We had no federal government before the Civil War. Then after the Civil War, we created a strong central government, and then over time, that was supplemented by state governments and local governments. And during certain eras, we had too much centralized power, and during others, we didn’t have enough. And so now we’ve got kind of a hybrid system. But ultimately, the question is how do we make sure that we’ve got checks and balances between our various levels of government and between our different branches of government, but also how do we empower ordinary citizens to be able to participate in the process? Because ultimately, government works only as long as we believe that it’s doing right by us.
### Assistant: So the purpose of government is to help the little guy and the little gal. So you mentioned the little guy. What about the little gal? Should we care about women's issues?
### Human: Absolutely. When it comes to issues like reproductive rights, which I know is an important topic for many people, but it's just as important that women have equal pay for equal work, that we have workplace protections, that we have paid leave, that we have quality childcare, that we have programs to help women entrepreneurs, that we have opportunities for young girls to pursue careers in science and technology and math and coding. All of these things matter to women because it means their families will be better off and ultimately our whole country will be stronger.
Now, men benefit from these same kinds of policies as well. Obviously men have unique needs and interests as well. But overall, we’ll be better off if we treat both men and women equally and give everybody the chance to live up to their God-given potential.
### Assistant: In addition to being a president, you were a community organizer. You said that “The biggest problems we face don't have easy fixes, and there's no such thing as a magic bullet.” Can you tell me how you approach problem solving when you were in office and still today?
### Human: Sure. First, I try to listen to people and understand what their concerns are and what they consider to be the major challenges that they’re facing. Then I figure out where can we make progress using tools that exist within the political system and/or the regulatory system. Sometimes we need new laws. Other times we need to use existing laws more effectively. Sometimes we need to find ways to partner with businesses, nonprofits, foundations, etc., to try to solve problems. And sometimes, depending on the issue, we may have to marshal coalitions that cut across party lines.
I always say that the job of elected officials is to represent the will of the people. And so if the people want to see more action on gun safety or immigration or climate change, then we shouldn’t be afraid to lead on those issues. Of course, there are limits to what we can accomplish. Even if we pass a great piece of legislation, it won’t work unless we actually enforce it. And that requires having good cops on the beat and prosecutors in the courthouse and folks at DHS who are going to implement the laws dealing with immigration. So it really starts and ends with making sure that you've got people who are dedicated to carrying out whatever you've put into place.
But broadly speaking, I'm convinced that if you're willing to listen to people, if you're willing to try to compromise instead of just taking maximalist positions that
### Assistant: that it doesn't have to be gridlocked, that you can actually make progress.
### Human: I mean, frankly, it helps if you have some common ground with members of Congress from the other side of the aisle, otherwise it's not worth negotiating. If you just want to show how tough you are, you might score some points with your base, but you’re not actually going to be able to move the needle on any particular issue.
