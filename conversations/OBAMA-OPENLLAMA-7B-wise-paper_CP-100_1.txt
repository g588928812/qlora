### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you run for president? Why did you decide to enter this race?

President Obama: Well, I think it was inevitable that somebody like me would eventually get into politics because I grew up around political activity. My dad had spent some time involved in civil rights activism and antiwar activism when I was young. And I grew up with friends whose parents were activists. So I had a certain expectation of what life could be about. But there were moments along the way where I thought maybe I'll go do something else. Maybe I will write books or become a professor or something else. But then at some point I realized that what motivated me was trying to make sure everybody had a fair shot and everybody’s voice mattered. And so I ended up deciding to try to serve my country, which meant running for public office.
Assistant: What was your motivation? Was it to change things? To improve people’s lives? Or was it just to have power?
### Human: You know, I don’t think I ever expected power. I never imagined myself as some kind of tyrant. I didn’t imagine myself wanting to be in charge. It’s always been about making sure other people have a chance. And I remember talking to Michelle one day and saying “You know, we might end up in the White House.” She said “Well, that sounds nice but why do you want to?” I said, “Because I think if we can bring the American family together again and show them how they can rise above their differences and see themselves not only as Democrats or Republicans, but Americans,” That sounded good to her. And I think that’s really what drew me back. Because I knew that I had seen during those years I was campaigning and even before that that people had lost hope. They felt disconnected. They felt alienated. And I wanted to reconnect with them and give them a sense that their voices mattered.
Assistant: The story behind the election, it wasn’t supposed to happen, right? I mean, you know, Hillary Clinton had won Iowa. You didn’t win Iowa. Did you think that was going to happen?
### Assistant: No.
### Human: Yeah, no. There were several polls taken in December of ’07 and early January where it looked like she might pull away. There were a couple of polls where we actually tied each other. One poll showed us ahead. But most people were predicting Hillary would win. And so I didn’t expect to win Iowa. And in fact, we got beat pretty badly in New Hampshire. And it took a lot of guts and determination to keep moving forward after that loss. I think that’s why I ended up winning Iowa. People saw me fight back against the pundits and analysts and reporters. They saw that I wasn’t giving up. They saw that I wasn’t afraid. And I think that helped propel us through the rest of the campaign.
### Assistant: You mentioned the Iowa caucus. Do you remember the moment where you won Iowa?
President Obama: Yes. Absolutely. It was a cold winter night in February of ’08. And it was the last contest that we were scheduled to participate in, although it was far earlier than anybody expected. But it was the one state where Hillary Clinton had an edge over me. And I went out to Iowa and spoke to folks. And it was freezing cold that night. And I gave this speech in front of thousands of people and talked about our shared values and talked about how we were going to take care of children and seniors and veterans. And I also talked about how we had to build bridges between red states and blue states. We couldn’t just retreat into ourselves anymore. And then afterwards, we had to count the votes. And we were leading. I believe there were somewhere between 36% and 37%. We were within striking distance of Hillary. Then the next morning, all these newspapers came out. Some of them put me up at the top of the page. Some of them said Hillary won by double digits. And I was like, wow, these pundits are getting it wrong again. But what I noticed is that a lot of people were coming up to me and shaking my hand and telling me that they liked what I stood for and they supported me. And that was enough for me to say okay, I’m gonna stay focused on this
### Human: I think one of the things that happened that evening was, it’s interesting that you talk about Hillary having the lead, and Iowa is the state where she had the lead because she was from Illinois, and so she had the home court advantage. Iowa was the first place where people started looking at the polls and saying well, I wonder if Senator Obama could possibly win this thing. And then suddenly everybody jumped onto our bandwagon. And so what happened was that in the final polling before Iowa, it was essentially a dead heat. Everybody believed we were going to lose Iowa. Nobody believed we were going to win Iowa. Then the polling came out the next day showing Hillary Clinton winning by double digits, and everybody thought Hillary Clinton had won Iowa. And what happened is that Iowa became a turning point in this process. Suddenly everyone began to realize that yes, this guy could win. He could actually compete nationally. And so that’s the moment where I think we began to shift national attention to our candidacy.
Assistant: When you look back at the campaign, what is the defining moment? Is there a specific moment where you feel like you found yourself, where you were able to speak directly to the hearts of Americans and connect with them?
### Assistant: That was the Iowa Caucuses. I think that’s what defined you as a candidate.
### Human: Well, I don’t know if I agree with that statement. I think that the Iowa Caucuses showed us that we had a viable path towards victory. I wouldn’t say it defined us. I think that we were already defining ourselves. I mean, we had gone out to Iowa and done everything we could to demonstrate that we cared deeply about the people living in Iowa and that we weren’t going to let any cynicism or negativity stop us from connecting with voters. But I think the Iowa Caucuses allowed us to say hey, we’re here to stay. We’ve got a chance to compete nationally now. And we began to draw more and more support.
Assistant: So you think the caucuses were the turning point.
### Assistant: No, I think the caucuses were the defining moment.
### Human: Defining moment, yeah.
