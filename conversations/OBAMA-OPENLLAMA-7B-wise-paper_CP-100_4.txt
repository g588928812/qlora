### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why is it that we can't find common ground? You were president during this period of deep division, and I think there are many reasons why we couldn't find common ground. But could you just give your own personal assessment? What was going on? What's going on today? Is the polarization worse than it used to be? Is America more divided now than ever before? And if so, how did it get this way?
### Human: Well, let me take a step back because you asked me about what I do these days and one thing I've tried to do since leaving office is reflect a little bit on where we've come from. We're not where we need to go but we have made some progress. And I think part of what you see is the legacy of what happened after World War II. There had been a lot of racial segregation in our country, obviously Jim Crow laws. There was slavery. There was discrimination against women. It wasn’t just a matter of people saying “Oh, we shouldn't treat them differently.” People literally had laws passed which said they couldn't eat at restaurants or attend schools or vote or participate in public life in ways that white Americans took for granted.
### Assistant: So you mean legally enforced? Yes.
### Human: Legally enforced segregation and discrimination. Then, after World War II, when we began to rebuild Europe, Africa, Asia, we didn't want those countries to follow suit. We wanted them to embrace democracy and freedom. But we also realized that we needed to look inward and address the inequalities that existed within our own country. That's what led us to pass civil rights legislation. That's what led us to integrate our military. That's what led us to elect presidents like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson who were committed to advancing civil rights. That's what led us to pass the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. And that process culminated in the Civil Rights Movement, which brought down Jim Crow, and then we got the Voting Rights Act signed into law in 1965.
So what happened? After that, we began to make significant progress. We elected a black mayor of Atlanta, Maynard Jackson. The first woman elected governor in Georgia, Zell Miller. We elected Harold Ford Jr., the first black congressman from Tennessee since Reconstruction. Congress passed the Martin Luther King holiday. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. All of these things happened. But then we entered the Reagan Era, which was marked by deregulation, tax cuts, and budget deficits that helped create a growing gap between rich and poor and contributed to the unraveling of the social safety net. As a result, by
### Assistant: What does Reagan mean to you personally? What is the Reagan era? How does he figure into your political thinking?
### Human: Well, Ronald Reagan was an icon for conservatives. He became an idol. And conservatives embraced him because he espoused a certain ideology. In particular, he rejected the idea that government had any role to play in helping ordinary folks improve their lives. Government should simply protect private property owners and keep taxes low. He believed that markets would solve all problems. And while he was right about markets solving a lot of problems, he ignored the fact that market economies require regulation. They don't function properly without regulation. Otherwise, businesses would cheat consumers and workers. If you let companies pollute waterways or exploit their employees, that hurts everybody else. Markets can work well, but only if they operate under rules and regulations that ensure fairness. And Reagan didn't believe in that kind of government intervention. So he attacked programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. He proposed replacing Social Security with voluntary savings accounts and eliminating welfare altogether. He argued that people should rely solely on themselves rather than depending on the government. And that was a fundamental break with previous Republican leaders. Prior to Reagan, Republicans tended to support these kinds of federal programs that ensured Americans could live comfortably and retire safely. Reagan's agenda was much more focused on cutting taxes for the wealthy and reducing spending on domestic programs that benefited working families. He argued that we should eliminate taxes on capital gains and dividends, even though the top income earners already paid lower rates than middle class taxpayers. He also advocated for huge
### Assistant: Tax breaks for corporations and oil companies and big banks and Wall Street firms.
### Human: Exactly. And he insisted that we reduce taxes for small businesses. And he was willing to balance the budgets, which he claimed would encourage investment and economic growth. But Reagan was wrong. Lowering taxes for the wealthy doesn't spur job creation. Instead, it creates bigger disparities between the richest Americans and everyone else. And slashing corporate tax rates doesn't lead to higher wages for workers. When Reagan cut taxes, productivity increased, but jobs declined. And the number of workers employed in manufacturing fell sharply. Meanwhile, the wealthiest Americans saw their incomes rise dramatically. Reagan's supply-side economics failed miserably, and his trickle-down approach to fiscal policy actually created greater inequality. And that's exactly what we experienced during his eight years in office. Between 1983 and 1989, the average household income grew by 10%, but the incomes of households making over $5 million doubled. Meanwhile, median incomes fell by almost four percent and poverty rates rose. By the time Reagan left office, the average family was earning less than it had in 1979. And we hadn't seen anything close to those levels of inequality before Reagan came along.
### Assistant: So I guess, you know, you're giving Reagan credit for creating the conditions for inequality. You're blaming him for the explosion of inequality that occurred afterwards. But I wonder whether Reagan's policies were really responsible for the inequality or whether they were simply exacerbating the effects of structural forces that were happening anyway. Maybe I should ask another question: Where are we now? Where are we headed? Where is America heading in terms of its political divisions?
### Human: Well, first, I think Reagan deserves credit for sparking a backlash against liberalism in general, but especially among conservative voters. Many Americans felt betrayed by Democrats, whom they blamed for the stagnant economy and rising crime rates. Their anger helped fuel Reagan's election in 1980. Reagan won reelection four years later despite the fact that unemployment remained high throughout most of his second term. But he still managed to win again. One reason was that voters increasingly identified themselves with Reagan. They saw him as a symbol of patriotism, conservatism, and traditional values. His appeal transcended party lines. Conservatives flocked to him en masse, while moderates voted for him reluctantly. Some of these voters eventually became disillusioned with Reagan once he was in office. But others stayed loyal because he spoke to their beliefs and values. Reagan appealed to voters' fears, promising to protect America from communists and terrorists. He told Americans that they were better off than other nations and urged them to reject socialism and collectivism. In short, he appealed to Americans' desire to preserve their way of life and defend their freedoms. His popularity gave Republicans a new sense of confidence. They knew they could compete nationally and win elections, even in blue states like California. And they soon began pushing a far-right agenda that included slashing taxes, privatizing government services, and dismantling protections for workers and consumers. These changes sparked fierce debates within both parties, but
