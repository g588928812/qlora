### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think so many people voted for Donald Trump?
### Human: I'm not sure it was such a big surprise that there were people who voted for him because they felt ignored by Washington. They felt their voices hadn’t been heard during the previous eight years when we had a Democratic president. And then what surprised me more than anything else was just how much venom he generated among some voters even before he won the Republican nomination. And this was based largely around race, partly based around economic anxiety. But at its core, it was about a particular view of America that we're weak and we need to be strong again. We need to get tough again. And somehow if we cut back on our social safety net, and we basically go back to the way things were in the ‘50s and early ‘60s, which is a lot of men working, women mostly homemakers, black Americans in certain parts of the country still getting hosed by real estate agents, Latinos in other parts of the country not having a pathway to citizenship, Asians essentially shut out of certain kinds of jobs. There are going to be winners and losers no matter what. But the notion that somehow we can turn back the clock and that those folks will benefit economically is just not true. The fact that somebody like Mr. Trump could generate enough support to actually win the White House and govern for four years tells us something about the state of our union right now.
### Assistant: So let me ask another set of questions. What was your own experience with racism growing up?
### Human: You know, I grew up in Hawaii where it wasn’t really a racial issue. It was an issue of whether you liked football or basketball or surfing. Or did you play the piano or violin? Was it classical music or jazz? These weren’t issues that were fundamentally grounded in race per se. Of course, there were kids whose parents came from different backgrounds and there were some taunts and teasing and name calling along the way but overall I got a pretty good dose of the American dream. My father left Kenya when he was a teenager. He didn’t finish high school. At one point, he was a cook. Eventually he saved enough money and brought himself over to the United States and ended up in a small town in Kansas called Honululu in Hawaii. where he met my mom, a white woman from a very modest background herself. She worked her way through college and became a teacher. I have an older sister and brother who are half Kenyan and they look like me. And so I guess what I would say is that although obviously throughout my life I’ve run into some folks who don’t particularly like the idea of having a Black man in the White House, most of the time it hasn’t been an overtly racist experience for me personally.
### Assistant: Is there any sense though, that you've experienced racism directly or indirectly?
### Human: Absolutely. If I think back to my experiences in both high school and then later in law school, there were definitely moments where either someone said something outright to me, or maybe somebody who might have had similar skin color to mine decided not to sit next to me in class. Those kinds of incidents happened, but fortunately, for the most part, I was shielded from them growing up in Hawaii because frankly, there weren’t all too many people who looked like me. In fact, the only place where you might see somebody who looks kind of like me might have been in the international club or playing on the tennis team or some other sport. So these were rare occurrences. Once I went off to college and eventually law school and started meeting a broader array of people from different walks of life, it was clear that yeah, this stuff happens and it does impact people’s lives. Whether it's keeping somebody from getting hired for a job or deciding to move somewhere because of something somebody said or not saying hello to somebody because of the color of their skin. All of that stuff matters.
### Assistant: How does it make you feel when you hear stories of everyday people who are struggling financially, people who have lost their homes because of the pandemic, or people who are angry because they've lost their jobs and are blaming others for that? How does that make you feel?
### Human: Well, it makes me sad. Obviously, nobody likes to see people struggle. Nobody likes to see people lose their jobs. But at the same time, it also gives me hope because I recognize that there are millions upon millions of Americans who are doing exactly the right thing. For example, they lost their job, but instead of simply giving up and saying, “I can't find work,” they're looking hard every day to figure out where they can take advantage of new opportunities. Maybe they decide to retrain themselves so they can do something else besides the work they did before. Maybe they decide to spend more time with family and less time working long hours. Whatever it may be, these are the sorts of things that ultimately create a dynamic economy that works for everybody rather than just a few at the top.
That's why I was heartened by the fact that last year despite losing their jobs, despite having their incomes disrupted, despite seeing businesses close and friends and neighbors and relatives lose their health insurance because of the disruption to the individual market. Despite all that, we saw the vast majority of Americans pull together and say, “We want to come back stronger.” That’s what the American people are all about. They want to bounce back, they want to make sure that their families are safe, they want to make sure that their communities are healthy, and they understand that none of us succeed unless we all do well.
But at the same time, there are
### Assistant: people who are frustrated.
### Human: Angry, yes, frustrated. Yes, absolutely. Because even though they recognize that they've done the right thing by staying home and wearing masks and washing their hands and making sure that their loved ones aren't sick, they nevertheless see that there are other parts of the country where those same basic protocols aren't being followed. So they become angry at what they perceive as a double standard. And that is understandable. And so the challenge for us is to explain to people that we've never been more united as a nation. We’ve always depended on each other and on our government to get through difficult times. That’s what we did after September 11th. That’s what we did after Hurricane Katrina. That’s what we did after Joplin and Moore, Oklahoma and Houston after Hurricane Harvey and Irma and Maria. Every time we've faced natural disasters, we’ve pulled together as a nation. And if we keep pulling together, I have confidence that we will emerge from this crisis even stronger than we were before.
