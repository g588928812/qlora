### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you believe America is great? And how does it get better?
### Human: Well, I think that's a big topic, right? If we go back to our founding documents, what makes us unique and special as Americans is not just a particular set of ideals about democracy and liberty, but also this idea that people should be free to pursue their own dreams and make their own choices. That's a pretty powerful thing; it allows individuals to realize themselves in ways they wouldn’t otherwise have done if there was some central authority telling them what they had to do. The flip side of that freedom, though, is responsibility. So when I grew up, my parents would tell me, “You can do anything you want. But if you fail, it’s all on you.” They didn’t have any illusions that somebody else could bail you out. You had to take ownership of your life, and that means sometimes failing. Sometimes you fall short. There are things you don’t accomplish. But at least you can say, “I gave it my best shot,” versus saying, “Well, somebody owed me something because I’m black, or Hispanic, or female.” And so that sense of personal accountability is part of the American ethos. That’s part of why I think it’s great. And then the second part of the equation, which is maybe more elusive, is we are able to reinvent ourselves over time. That’s not always true around the world. Some countries may become richer than others; some countries
### Assistant: Some countries don’t even have the luxury of being able to reinvent themselves over time.
### Human: Right. We’re constantly changing and evolving, and part of that comes from recognizing we live in a dynamic country where we are always going to face challenges. It doesn’t matter whether we’re dealing with the Civil War or World War II or Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan or Covid. As long as we remain open and adaptable and willing to listen to each other, to try new approaches, and to learn from mistakes, we will continue to succeed. Now, one of the reasons that I think America is special is because we’ve managed to maintain this spirit of innovation and dynamism even during difficult times. When we faced slavery and segregation, we overcame those problems through civil rights legislation and constitutional amendments. When we were confronted with fascism and Nazism, we defeated Hitler. In the middle of the Cold War with Russia, we developed the internet and computers. Even today, despite our divisions and frustrations, we are still trying to find solutions for the issues facing the nation. Whether it’s climate change, gun violence, racial equity, education reform, infrastructure improvements, the pandemic, whatever these are, we’ll figure it out. Because we understand that ultimately we can solve these problems together rather than apart.
### Assistant: Yeah, it’s interesting. You talk about the Civil War, the Second World War. Those are the moments that define America as far as I’m concerned. That’s when America became great. Because the Civil War is when America decided to fight for justice, equality, against oppression. The Second World War defined America in terms of its global leadership and the way we fought for justice, equality, against oppression. So I think those moments are really important. But we have this tradition of reinvention, which seems to be ongoing. Is that something you see? Or is that something that’s unique to America?
### Human: I think that’s part of the uniqueness of America. But it’s also why there’s such optimism among many Americans, especially young Americans, who look at the past and recognize that even though there were dark days and bad periods and things got worse before they got better, nonetheless, we came out of it stronger and we survived and we learned lessons and we adapted and we evolved and we continued to thrive. And that’s a source of hope for everybody because if we can overcome slavery and Jim Crow and the Cold War and the Great Recession and the pandemic, we will surely overcome everything else too.
### Assistant: What do you wish people understood about the role race played throughout American history? Especially now, as we reflect on the last several years since George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshard Brooks and Jacob Blake and Tony McDade and Philando Castile and Michael Brown Jr. and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin and Walter Scott and Freddie Gray and Stephon Clark and Alton Sterling and Michael Brown Sr. and Korryn Gaines and Samuel DuBose and Keith Lamont Scott and Terence Crutcher and Daniel Shaver and Botham Jean and Atatiana Jefferson and Christian Taylor and Sean Bell and Oscar Grant and John Crawford III and Jordan Edwards and Tyisha Miller and Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond and James Boyd and Akai Gurley and Victor White and Manuel Loggins Jr. and Laquan McDonald and Dillon Taylor and Jonathan Ferrell and Jeronimo Yanez and Philando Castile and Alton Sterling and Justine Damond and Alvin Cole and Casey Goodson Jr. and Daunte Wright and Javier Ambler and Dominique Clayton and Maurice Gordon and Erik Salgado and Adam Toledo and Antonio Williams and Elijah McClain and George Floyd and Daunte Wright and Ahmad Aubrey and Jason Walker and Casey Goodson Jr. and Andre Hill and Casey Christopher Goodson Jr. and Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and Kyle Ritten
### Human: I mean, the list goes on. Unfortunately, there’s no shortage of examples. And the reason why it matters is because it continues to shape our national discourse. It affects how people vote. It affects how people view each other. It affects how police officers act towards communities of color. It affects how communities of color react towards law enforcement officials. It affects how politicians behave. And I think it’s important that we acknowledge that, yes, there have been improvements over time. Things like civil rights legislation and affirmative action and voting rights acts helped bring us closer to realizing Dr. King’s vision of the beloved community. And yet, unfortunately, there’s still too much injustice and unfairness and discrimination in society. And so what happens is that it creates tensions between different groups. And oftentimes, that tension becomes violent because we haven’t figured out a peaceful way to resolve disagreements. And so when people see injustice, they’re naturally going to feel anger and frustration. And then if that anger and frustration isn’t channeled into productive efforts towards addressing the problem, it tends to fester until it explodes. And so the fact that we have this constant stream of tragedies, I think underscores the need for us to keep working to bridge divides and build trust between communities and improve policing practices nationwide.
### Assistant: One of the things that struck me when looking at some of the names listed above is that these are all Black men. Do you think racism is a bigger issue in America today than it was during the Civil Rights era? How do you respond to that?
### Human: Look, I’d say there’s certainly more awareness of racism and anti-racism than ever before. And that’s partly because of the hard work of activists, and lawyers, and journalists, and academics, and organizers over decades who have brought these issues to light. And I think that’s helpful. However, I also worry that there’s a tendency to oversimplify the nature of the problem. For instance, we often hear about white supremacy, which is obviously a real threat. It exists and needs to be confronted. On the other hand, we also have to acknowledge that systemic racism refers to structural barriers based on race that disadvantage minorities, particularly blacks. And while it may sound obvious that racism hurts minority communities, the truth is, when it comes to wealth inequality, homeownership rates, unemployment rates, educational attainment levels, health outcomes, disparities in criminal justice sentencing, disparities in access to quality medical care, the evidence is overwhelming that these disparities exist not because of individual prejudice but because of systematic barriers that disproportionately affect communities of color. And so I think we need to focus less on the symptoms and more on the underlying causes of inequality and injustice in order to achieve meaningful progress.
