### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won the presidential election in November of 2016?
### Human: I don't know why Donald Trump won. Obviously we all saw that result coming. He was always going to be a formidable candidate because he's a celebrity, he had this huge base of supporters, he had lots of money, and so forth. But beyond that, there were many reasons why it turned out the way it did. One, he benefited enormously from the fact that Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate. She had her own problems in terms of trustworthiness and authenticity, and also she got very badly burned politically when the e-mail scandal broke. So even though the polls showed her leading consistently throughout the entire campaign season, she never really seemed to get comfortable commanding a lead. And then finally, Donald Trump was able to tap into some legitimate grievances about the economy and jobs that have not fully recovered since the Great Recession. And so I think that the combination of those three things allowed him to overcome her advantages in name recognition, money, experience, and organization.
### Assistant: Can you elaborate on each one of them individually? The last point you mentioned was economic issues. What are some examples of what kind of economic issues?
### Human: Economic anxiety is the phrase that's used. You know, people feel like they're working hard, but they haven't seen their wages go up. They haven't seen their standard of living improve. People who lost their jobs during the recession are still unemployed. There's a lot of frustration with how long it's taken to recover from the recession. And Donald Trump said he would fix these problems. And he promised that if elected, he would create more jobs and boost wages and make sure that everybody benefits from our prosperity.
### Assistant: So the economic issue was a general one that affected everyone, that was felt universally across America, whether or not you voted Republican or Democrat.
### Human: It certainly wasnâ€™t limited to Republicans, although obviously there were many Republicans who voted for him, too. Some of them may have thought he could actually deliver on his promises. Others just liked his bombast and didn't care much about substance. But there were plenty of Democrats who voted for him, too.
### Assistant: That's interesting. Well, let's talk about what your role was at the time and what your thoughts were regarding the campaign and the election itself. What was going through your mind before Election Day?
### Human: Well, my job at that point was to try to figure out where Secretary Clinton might fall short electorally and what the most effective ways might be to try to help her close any gaps between herself and Mr. Trump. In addition to that, we spent quite a bit of time trying to anticipate where voters were going to break, which states she needed to win in order to become president, and what the best strategies would be to maximize the chances of winning those states. Beyond that, we also tried to think about what she needed to do once she became president to ensure her success. And obviously, you want to have a clear plan for what you want to accomplish early on in your administration so that Congress will enact your agenda and you can implement it successfully.
So that's basically what we were thinking about during the summer and fall of 2016. Of course, we knew there were real risks associated with running against Donald Trump because he had no political experience. He hadn't held office previously, and he hadn't demonstrated any ability to govern effectively. But we figured we'd take those risks anyway because she was probably the strongest potential nominee that we could put forward given that field of candidates that year.
### Assistant: Did you ever imagine yourself running for president? If you look back today, would you run for president again? Would you consider it?
### Human: No. I love public service. I enjoy helping others. My life has been devoted to doing that in different capacities, whether I was practicing law, teaching constitutional law, or serving in public office. So no, I wouldn't consider another presidential campaign. However, I am proud to say that I'm currently serving as chair of the board of trustees for the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where my kids attended school. And so I remain deeply committed to education and making sure that every child gets the chance to succeed regardless of race or background or income level. And I hope that I can continue to play some useful role in supporting the next generation of leaders.
