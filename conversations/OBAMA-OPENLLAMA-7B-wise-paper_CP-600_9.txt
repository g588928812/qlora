### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did Donald Trump win the election?
### Human: I don't know that we can say why he won the election, but what we do know is this was one of the most consequential elections in our lifetime. And it wasn’t because of any single thing; it was because of multiple factors that had come together in ways that surprised even people who were paying attention. It was the result of a lot of dissatisfaction among certain groups of voters, a sense that things weren’t working the way they should have been. And then you had some pretty aggressive campaigning by Mr. Trump and by those who supported him. There were also issues like the Comey letter, where there was some perception that the FBI was biased against Hillary Clinton, which then spurred a lot of questions about whether she was qualified to be president. Then there were concerns about terrorism after San Bernardino, which spurred fears and anxieties around immigration. And then finally, just a general malaise that had settled over the country in the wake of the Great Recession, which was still ongoing at the time, and questions about how well the recovery was going. And so all these different elements came together, and it resulted in something that no one expected. So nobody saw this coming. No one could have predicted that somebody like Donald Trump would become president, much less get elected. But when he got elected, what was striking is not necessarily that he won, although that was surprising enough in itself, but more that he managed to win despite having some
### Assistant: I'm sorry to interrupt. What was surprising to you personally about the results?
### Human: Well, I think the fact that anybody would have been surprised that someone like Donald Trump would be elected is remarkable in and of itself, considering everything we knew about him prior to the campaign. We knew that he was a businessman who hadn't held public office before. We knew that he had a reputation for being brash and outspoken and controversial. We knew that he was a reality TV star who was famous for saying outrageous things. We knew that he had run for president once before and lost badly in the Republican primaries. So none of those things suggested that he would go on to win the nomination, let alone the general election. The idea that somebody like him could possibly win seemed almost inconceivable.
### Assistant: Is it possible though to put yourself into the mind of somebody who was voting for him, or maybe even thinking about voting for him, during the primaries? Or is it impossible to understand that worldview?
### Human: I think it's always difficult to try to put ourselves in other people's shoes. That said, there are certainly some common threads among many of the people who voted for Mr. Trump. They tended to be white, working class Americans without college degrees who felt left behind by globalization and technological change. These are folks who had seen their jobs disappear overseas or moved away from traditional manufacturing communities and didn't feel like anyone was listening to them anymore. They felt like their interests weren't represented by either political party, and they were frustrated and angry about the state of the economy. In addition, there were some social issues that were important to these voters, including opposition to abortion and support for gun rights. Finally, there was an element of racial resentment, particularly directed towards black and brown populations, which helped explain why Mr. Trump was able to attract such strong support among whites without college degrees, even if he himself was relatively moderate on race-related issues compared to some of his supporters.
### Assistant: How does that fit into your understanding of America today? I mean, I guess it seems to be a bit of a puzzle. Because there doesn't seem to be anything economically wrong in terms of unemployment rate and growth and so forth. It seems to be a cultural issue rather than an economic issue.
### Human: Yeah, I think that's true. And I think part of what explains it is that these working-class voters have been feeling increasingly disconnected from both parties over the past few decades. For example, Democrats have become more focused on identity politics while Republicans have moved further to the right on economic policy. As a result, neither party has really addressed the concerns of these voters in recent years. And this has left them feeling alienated and powerless, which has created fertile ground for demagogues like Mr. Trump to exploit.
### Assistant: And then, of course, you have the Russian interference. Can you talk about that aspect of the election?
### Human: Yes, absolutely. Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election was a major scandal that rocked the nation and threatened to undermine faith in our democratic institutions. The fact that foreign powers tried to interfere in our democracy is appalling and should never happen again. However, contrary to popular belief, the evidence suggests that Russia's efforts only marginally affected the outcome of the election. While their actions may have influenced some individuals' votes, there is no clear evidence that they changed the overall result of the election. Furthermore, it's worth noting that the impact of Russian interference pales in comparison to the myriad legitimate reasons why Hillary Clinton lost the election (e.g., her lackluster performance as Secretary of State, trustworthiness issues, etc.). Ultimately, it's important to remember that the outcome of the 2016 election was determined by a variety of factors, not just Russian interference.
