### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump was elected president? I don't mean politically speaking, but why do you think he won?
### Human: Well, there are many reasons. And some of them had nothing to do with him, right? So it's worth understanding how this happened. I spent eight years trying to get people to vote. We got record turnouts in '08 and '12, which were great. Turnout fell back down in '16. And so while we can argue about what percentage of that dropoff was due to voter suppression efforts, whether it was Russian interference, whether it was just apathy, you know, there were legitimate reasons why people didn’t show up at the polls. But then in 2020, you know, despite everything else going on, you know, including a pandemic, you know, a significant percentage of people turned out again. So if you look at all those factors together, we had a lot of people who were eligible to vote who weren’t voting because they couldn't be bothered. They felt like their votes didn't matter. Maybe they believed the falsehoods spread by folks like Mr. Trump suggesting that our elections were rigged. Then you add to that mix somebody who comes along and says, “I alone can fix” whatever problem you want to talk about. “Everything is terrible.” That message resonated even though most Americans thought that the economy was doing pretty well. Most Americans thought that our foreign policy wasn't working. Most Americans said that we needed to deal with health care. And yet somehow
### Assistant: The singular man, the one person could solve everything.
### Human: Exactly. Even though everyone knew that nobody's one person can solve anything. You need to have coalitions, you need compromises. Somebody who's willing to say that they're going to ignore the Constitution when it suits their purposes. He said things during the campaign that he still hasn’t admitted publicly, although others have come forward to tell us exactly what he said and meant behind closed doors. It doesn't surprise me that a number of suburban women voted against him because they heard him saying these things. Whether it was about his treatment of women, whether it was about his comments about African Americans or Latinos, and now we hear reports about his own taxes. None of it surprises me. What does surprise me is how hard so many of our fellow citizens are working to normalize what this guy is doing. How often they give him credit for good economic news. I remember during one of the debates, someone asked me about something that I had done in office, and he interrupted before I even answered and said, “You didn't create jobs, I did.” As if it was his job to create jobs. Then he goes on to brag about how many cars he sold or how many houses he built. Meanwhile, millions of people lost their jobs during that same period. Millions of families lost their homes during that same period. Yet somehow he gets the credit because his businesses were doing better than other people’s businesses. Or he gets the credit for
### Assistant: because the stock market went up.
### Human: Because the stock market went up, which means very little unless you happen to be invested in stocks yourself. And I suspect that many of his voters aren’t.
### Assistant: If you’re listening to this interview, please do not call into any of the shows where I’m appearing and say that I said that the stock market went up because of Barack Obama. I never once in my life talked about the stock market and its relation to anything except actual performance. I am not responsible for the rise of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
### Human: There’s no doubt that he used every tool available to him to try to boost the economy during his time in office. There’s also no doubt that he inherited an economy that was already showing signs of improvement when he came into office. In fact, unemployment was falling before he took over. When you look at the totality of what he did, especially compared to what George W. Bush did, which was basically throw gas on the fire after 9/11, and then go ahead and take us to war in Iraq without bothering to find out whether we should or shouldn’t. That was a disaster economically and otherwise. I’m not excusing myself. I’m just saying that I tried to do positive things for the country. I focused on education. I focused on expanding access to affordable healthcare. I worked to make sure that we were investing more in infrastructure. And I kept telling everybody that it was going to cost money. And guess what? People wanted lower taxes. So if you want to spend money, you have to pay for it. Either you tax people less, which would mean they wouldn’t have enough money left over to buy stuff, so therefore, demand would fall. Or you raise revenue through higher taxes, which means that some people might decide they don’t want to buy your product anymore, but hopefully you’ve diversified your customer base and you’ll be okay. But anyway, that was the challenge. But what
### Assistant: was the attitude towards government spending during that time? Was there a Republican Congress?
### Human: Yes. Yes, there was. And throughout most of my time in public service, whenever anyone would propose making investments in infrastructure or research and development or early childhood education programs or things that will help lift people up, instead of coming back and saying, “We support that,” what they’d say is, “Show me the money!” And the reason they would say that is because historically, Republicans and Democrats alike, until very recently, understood that we live in a society in which we all benefit when somebody else succeeds. Nowadays, too many people seem to believe that if someone else is getting something for free, it must necessarily be bad for them. That’s just simply not true. And so I think part of what contributed to this environment of rising inequality and stagnant wages is that so much of what we saw happening was justified based on this idea that the pie is shrinking. Whereas in reality, there were plenty of opportunities to grow the pie. Just as we had an opportunity during my time in office, but also prior to my time in office, to invest in things that would actually generate new wealth rather than just redistribute existing wealth.
