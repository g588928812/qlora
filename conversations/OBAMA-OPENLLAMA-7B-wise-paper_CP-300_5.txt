### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why is America the greatest country in the world?
### Human: I mean, you know what I think is true about America? I’m not going to try to sell you some mythological version of it that isn’t grounded in reality. It’s messy; it doesn’t always work perfectly; sometimes we get off course. But it’s also a place where if you have ambition and talent and drive and determination, there are plenty of opportunities out there for you to succeed beyond your wildest dreams. If you have a strong moral compass and want to make sure that other people have those same opportunities, then our government works pretty well. And even though we don’t agree all the time, we can still find common ground because we share certain values and traditions and institutions and ideals that bind us together. So while I am confident in America’s capacity to do good around the world, I’m equally confident in its capacity to be imperfect and fall short. I think we’ve fallen short at times. We should acknowledge those moments when we have fallen short and learn from them so that we can improve. But ultimately, I believe that if you look around the globe, if you look around the world, and you ask yourself which countries embody these aspirations and values and institutions that allow individuals to reach their full potential, I think most Americans would say we’re better than average. That’s why I ran for president. That’s why Michelle and I moved back to Chicago after the presidency. Because I wanted to
### Assistant: Do you see yourself as an optimist?
### Human: I do. I mean, you know, it’s funny. When I was growing up in Hawaii, I used to watch this show called Gilligan’s Island, and it featured three castaways stranded on an island. And one day, they were sitting around and they were talking about what they could do to survive on the island. And one person said, “Well, let’s just sit here and hope someone comes along.” Another person said, “No, no. We need to build a raft.” And then somebody else said, “We can’t build a raft until we have water.” And finally, this guy Gilligan says, “Okay, guys. We’ll go ahead and build the raft. Just give me five minutes. I’ll be right back.” He goes into the jungle, and he comes back a half hour later, and he shows them the raft. And they’re like, “Gilligan!” He’s like, “I knew I had the best idea.”
### Assistant: How does that relate to the greatest country in the world?
### Human: Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess what I’m saying is that we can’t wait for someone to come along and save us. We have to stand up ourselves, take responsibility for each other. And that requires not just optimism but action.
### Assistant: In your view, is the problem with America that we haven't taken action or we haven't done enough to realize our promise as a nation?
### Human: Both. You know, one of the reasons I decided to run for office was that I felt like America hadn’t lived up to its potential over the last decade, and that there were many challenges facing our economy and society that weren’t getting addressed in Washington. And during my eight years in office, I tried to make progress on those issues, whether it was passing legislation that put millions more kids in preschool or raising the minimum wage, expanding access to health insurance, investing in infrastructure, making sure that women got paid equal pay for equal work, addressing climate change and bringing the war in Iraq to a responsible conclusion. We did a lot of things to strengthen our middle class and protect the poor and working families. But there were problems left unresolved. There were areas where we hadn’t achieved our highest ambitions.
And one of the things I learned over the years is that in order for us to overcome those obstacles and achieve those goals, it wasn’t enough for Democrats and Republicans just to disagree with each other. Sometimes we had to work across party lines to accomplish big things. The biggest single example was Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act passed Congress without a single Republican vote, and it’s now the law of the land. But once it became law, the Supreme Court upheld it. It survived several attempts to overturn it legislatively, and it survived the executive branch’s efforts to undermine it administratively. And despite all those attacks, we kept expanding coverage to millions of
### Assistant: Can I pause for a second and ask you something really important? What do you think of Ruth Bader Ginsburg?
### Human: Oh, she was terrific. She was a real hero in her own life. She was a trailblazer for women and girls throughout her career. And she’d been through a lot. You know, she was married to Marty Ginsberg, who died early, and then she lost her daughter to cancer. And yet she persevered and became a leader and mentor to countless young women. She never gave up.
