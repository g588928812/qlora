### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Donald Trump won the election? What do you attribute it to?
### Human: I actually don't know why, but I've got some theories. But one thing I will say about Trump is that he did something that nobody else would have done if they had been running for president in recent years. He said out loud what everybody was thinking, which is, “You know what? The country’s going downhill, we need to get tough.” And I think the fact that somebody ran against this tide and stood up and said, “We are better than our current situation,” and people responded to that, even though there were plenty of other candidates who were saying similar things, it doesn’t mean they were right, but at least they were saying something different than the status quo. And so, therefore, I think it’s easy to underestimate how much the status quo matters. Because when you look around the world today, you’re seeing places where people are just fed up with the way their societies are working; and in many cases, whether it’s China or Russia or Hungary or Turkey or Venezuela, there are politicians who are exploiting that discontent and promising them solutions that are going to make everything better again. So, yeah, I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with the system in America today. I think we are living through a time in which we’ve never seen before where a lot of the basic rules of playing by the rules, getting ahead in life based upon merit and hard work, that those rules aren’
### Assistant: Yeah. We haven’t really discussed the role of meritocracy yet.
### Human: Well, that’s true. But I think we also recognize that those rules aren’t fair and we want to see them changed. But I think the challenge is, How do we fix these problems without just throwing away all the progress that we’ve made over the last half century or more in terms of racial equality and gender equality and LGBT rights and women’s rights generally? And so what I worry about is we end up having a populist backlash against the changes that we’ve already achieved.
### Assistant: But isn’t the reason Trump won because he promised to throw away all that progress? Isn’t the promise that you’ll return us to the good old days?
### Human: That’s certainly part of it. You know, one thing I think about sometimes is there’s no such thing as a perfect candidate. If there were, then everybody would vote for him or her. Right? Everybody loves perfection until the day after Election Day, and then suddenly you realize you didn’t like it anymore. But what makes elections interesting is that you have imperfect choices, and sometimes one choice can be worse than another, depending upon what your priorities are. So, you know, I’m sure you remember back during the campaign, when I used to ask people, you know, what’s most important to you in deciding whom you’re voting for? And often they’d say, “Oh, it’s character.” Character matters. Character counts. You gotta judge a book by its cover. Then I’d say, well, let me tell you what’s most important to me. It’s competence. You’ve got to pick the person whose ideas and policies are going to help solve the problem. Because otherwise, if you elect someone who’s incompetent, they’re not gonna help you anyway. So I think that’s a real dilemma that voters face every four years. They say, hey, “I wanna be guided by my gut feeling, I wanna be guided by my heart,” but the truth is, ultimately you need to base your decision on what the facts are telling you. Because otherwise, you might be
### Assistant: you might be making the wrong decisions.
### Human: Exactly. And so I guess my point is, is that, you know, in retrospect, it’s easy to say, oh, the election should have turned out differently because this or that candidate should have won. But at the same time, I think it’s equally clear that neither Hillary Clinton nor Jeb Bush nor Marco Rubio nor any of the others, including Bernie Sanders, could have beaten Donald Trump. And so I think that’s always the challenge is figuring out which imperfect choice is going to lead you towards the best outcome. And so you have to weigh character against competence. And I guess what I’m suggesting is that you have to be willing to accept the risk that you might choose the less competent individual because they seem more appealing to you emotionally.
### Assistant: Is that a lesson you learned personally?
### Human: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, listen, I went into office knowing that I wasn’t qualified to be president, which meant I knew that I needed to surround myself with smart advisers who could advise me and tell me what to do, and I would trust their judgment. And so the reality is that every president since World War II has relied heavily on advisors and on experts who give them advice on how to govern. In my case, I was fortunate enough to have a vice president who was extraordinarily talented, who took care of a lot of the domestic issues, while I focused on foreign policy. But even so, I relied heavily on national security advisors and intelligence officials and economic advisers and Cabinet officers and others to provide me with advice on how to govern effectively. And so I think the idea that somehow anybody who becomes president can do it all by themselves without relying on advisors is just naive and unrealistic. And so the key is finding folks who you trust and who have the expertise necessary to help guide you along. And hopefully you’re able to find those individuals early on in your administration. Because once you take office, it’s too late to try to figure out what you should be doing next. You’ve got to have figured that out before.
