### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that Joe Biden won? Why did he defeat Donald Trump in this last election? What was it about Joe Biden that resonated with voters?
### Human: I’m not going to try to answer definitively because there are so many variables at play here. But I will say this: I think one reason he won is simply because he had a message that was consistent with the values that people were already feeling. And that message was, “We need to return to some sense of normalcy.” That message was grounded in reality. We didn’t just need to go back to what we were doing before COVID-19, but what we should be doing now, which is getting vaccinated and masking up and making sure that our kids get educated in school rather than at home, while also trying to ensure that they have access to good nutrition and mental health support. So those were the kinds of messages that he conveyed over and over again. He talked about restoring decency to Washington. Restoring respect to public office. And ultimately, it wasn’t just a campaign slogan. It wasn’t something that he just said on the stump. You saw him living out that idea through everything he did during the course of the campaign.
And then when it came time to make decisions around personnel appointments, including Supreme Court nominations, he went ahead and nominated somebody who was qualified, respected across the ideological spectrum. He chose a running mate who was somebody who he knew well, who he thought was going to help move the needle forward, who could help him govern effectively if elected. And that’s exactly what Kamala Harris did once she
### Assistant: What do you think was the deciding factor? Was it decency? Was it competence? Is it something else? Because he’s been criticized for being boring.
### Human: Well, look, I don’t want to take anything away from Donald Trump, because I think he was certainly more entertaining than most politicians. But what Joe Biden showed throughout his career was that you can still communicate your ideas in ways that resonate with voters without resorting to the same kind of bombast and hyperbole and demagoguery. So I do believe that people responded positively to his message. They liked how he looked and sounded and felt like their president.
### Assistant: What do you mean they liked how he looked and sounded and felt like their president? I guess he embodied, even though he's a Democrat, he embodied the middle ground, the center ground of America.
### Human: I think that’s part of it. The other part of it is that he just felt like someone who was relatable. Someone who cared about them. Someone who wanted to solve problems in a bipartisan way rather than simply demonizing the opposition.
### Assistant: In terms of the political process, why do you think Democrats lost control of the Senate?
### Human: Again, too many factors. There were structural issues. Republicans benefited from gerrymandering. There was the fact that rural areas tended to vote Republican, even though fewer people live in rural areas today than they used to. Then there were individual candidates. Some Democratic senators weren’t able to win reelection despite having done pretty well in previous cycles.
### Assistant: What about in states where you would expect Republicans to lose? Where they traditionally haven’t performed well?
### Human: Look, there were a couple of places where Democrats outperformed expectations, especially Pennsylvania. And I give credit to John Fetterman for campaigning hard and putting himself out there. In Georgia, Raphael Warnock ran a great race. Stacey Abrams helped him prepare for that campaign and laid the foundation for a Democratic victory in that state. Those races ended up turning out very close, but ultimately fell in favor of the Republicans.
I think that overall, though, when you look at the composition of Congress after Election Day, Republicans wound up holding onto both chambers.
