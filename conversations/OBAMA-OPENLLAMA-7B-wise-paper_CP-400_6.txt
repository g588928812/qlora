### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we hate each other? What divides us? What are the divisions that make it difficult to come together?
### Human: Well, I think one of the biggest issues is this idea that somehow people should be judged based on their skin color or their national origin. And I know that sounds crazy, but if you grow up somewhere else than where you're born, then there's always going to be some suspicion about whether you’ve got the right qualifications to live here or whether you really belong here. There’s also the fact that our society has become so divided between rural and urban areas. And when you look at how we’re structured politically today and how the electoral college works, what happens in a city like Chicago doesn't matter nearly as much as what happens in Montana. And those differences create tensions.
### Assistant: So what are the solutions then? How do we bridge these gaps? How do we get rid of all this hatred?
### Human: I don't have any easy answers, especially given that the last four years have been marked by an increase in divisiveness. But I think what’s important is that we recognize the value of diversity, not just because of diversity itself, which is obviously good for economic growth, but also because it helps ensure that everybody feels they can contribute. In democracies, we believe in the notion that anybody who wants to participate has an equal opportunity to participate. When you start seeing people feel excluded, it makes them feel alienated. It starts making them feel that their government isn't serving them properly, and it undermines democracy. And ultimately, it means that those who are left behind, whether they're white working class voters or African Americans living in inner cities, are less likely to engage in civic life, and therefore less likely to vote, and thereby less likely to influence policy. So even though we might disagree over exactly why certain problems arise, the underlying point is that we need to find ways to build bridges. We need to figure out ways to work together rather than try to divide ourselves into different camps.
I think that's the lesson from Brexit, where you saw that the British decided they were better off cutting themselves off from Europe instead of trying to work with Europeans to solve common challenges. Or take immigration, which is another area where you see increasing hostility towards immigrants and refugees. The reality is that if you want to address the problems that cause people to
### Assistant: immigrate in the first place, you'll have to deal with migration management. If you want to address climate change, you'll have to deal with migration management. You'll have to deal with human rights violations around the world.
### Human: That's absolutely right. And so I think one of the things we need to do is recognize that when you look at the threats that confront humanity today, whether it's climate change, nuclear proliferation, pandemics, terrorism, cyberattacks, etc., These are global problems. They require international cooperation. And they’re only going to be solved through international cooperation. If we continue to go down this path of emphasizing division, then I fear we will undermine the very values that are most worth preserving.
### Assistant: Do you think we’ll ever return to normalcy after Trump leaves office?
### Human: Well, I hope we will. Certainly, the Biden administration will try to restore faith in American institutions. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen overnight. We saw what happened during the transition period, for example, where Trump refused to cooperate with Joe Biden and his team in setting up a new administration. And that was part of a larger pattern whereby Trump tried to undermine norms and traditions in American governance. Now, fortunately, once Biden took office, he did everything possible to try to rebuild confidence and trust in our democratic institutions. But it takes time, and I expect that there will still be plenty of controversies surrounding his presidency. At the same time, I think there's reason for optimism. After all, America survived eight years of George W Bush. We survived four years of Ronald Reagan. We survived eight years of Richard Nixon. We survived four years of Jimmy Carter.
### Assistant: So I guess what I mean by normalcy is more of the traditional political discourse that we have had since World War II, maybe since before that. Is that something we can ever return to? Because now we seem to be entering this phase of increased polarization.
### Human: Yes, I would say that there are signs that the country is healing. For example, although Republicans initially resisted efforts to wear masks in public places, there's evidence that that changed during the pandemic, and many states actually mandated mask wearing in schools and businesses. Similarly, while Trump insisted that schools reopen fully despite warnings from scientists that that would lead to an unacceptable level of infections among students and teachers, I think that Republican governors gradually came to realize that that wasn't a viable option either. And so I think what you're starting to see is a recognition that we have to follow scientific advice rather than blindly following whatever our leaders tell us to do. That doesn't mean that we're going to suddenly forget the lessons that we learned from Trump. Instead, I think what we're doing is recognizing that there's no single solution to our problems. As I said earlier, the problems facing us today are global in nature. They require international cooperation. And the way to succeed internationally is to learn to work together with others rather than to simply dictate to them what to do.
