### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are so many people so angry these days?
### Human: Well, I think that's the wrong question. The question should be what are we doing to make sure that everybody feels like they have a voice in our democracy and can actually get better jobs and good schools for their kids; that there aren’t folks who are working hard but still getting by while others are just gaming the system or making bad choices or taking advantage of them; that people feel hopeful about the future because we are constantly improving technology and science even if sometimes it seems like everything else around us isn't changing quite as fast. That’s the question. It’s not why are people mad? Because I think at any given time there will always be some people who are upset no matter how much we do right by our country. And when things don't go well, then that becomes more amplified and people become angrier. So my approach was never to ask, “Why are people so angry?” Instead, it was to say, “OK, how do we address the legitimate concerns that folks may have? How do we make sure that everyone feels like their voices are heard, that we’re creating opportunity, that we are expanding upward mobility? What are ways in which we can deal with issues of inequality and discrimination and poverty?” Those were the questions I asked myself every day as president rather than saying, “Oh my gosh, there must be something really wrong with America.” There may very well be something wrong with America if we’re not doing
### Assistant: stuff that helps.
### Human: Right. If we’re not doing enough, if we’ve got problems, then we ought to fix those problems, and we ought to figure out how to do it together. But if all you’re hearing from your political leaders is anger, or if you feel like somehow somebody else caused this problem, then you’re probably not going to be open to trying to find common ground solutions. You might not be willing to compromise because you’re convinced that whoever else is responsible for whatever the issue may be, they’re bad actors. They’re trying to rip off the American people. They’re trying to take away my job or they’re coming after my guns. Or maybe they want to legalize drugs and they’ll sell it to my kids. Or whatever the case may be.
### Assistant: And meanwhile, nothing gets done about real problems.
### Human: Yeah. So part of my message throughout my eight years was not only, hey, let’s look forward and try to solve new problems, but let’s also remember we’ve already solved some big ones. We can make sure that nobody goes without health insurance anymore. We can make sure that millions of young people are able to afford college. We can make sure that our economy is growing and that more businesses are starting up and that people who work hard are getting a chance to live a little bit better life. We’ve got a long way to go but we’ve come a long way. And yet, you know, instead of saying congratulations and now how can we build on this momentum, too often we’re just looking backwards and saying, oh, you didn’t do enough and you’re not sufficiently pure in your beliefs and therefore you need to be punished.
### Assistant: When did you start feeling this division between Americans becoming stronger and deeper?
### Human: Probably during the financial crisis back in ’08 and ’09 where it became clear that there had been some shenanigans on Wall Street that precipitated the collapse of Lehman Brothers. And that then triggered a whole bunch of other problems economically and financially around the world. And there wasn’t a lot of trust initially among average citizens that government was gonna step in and help. And so that’s when you started seeing tea party movement popping up. That’s when you started seeing people feeling like they needed to express their displeasure through the electoral process. And it was understandable because the anger was palpable. Nobody felt like Washington was acting responsibly. People were losing their homes. People were losing their jobs. Folks were worried about whether they could pay their mortgages. AIG went bankrupt. Some of the major banks nearly failed. And then over time, it sort of metastasized beyond that initial moment into broader frustrations. And the notion that somehow this election in 2016 was rigged and stolen, that there was fraud everywhere and that the mainstream media doesn’t care about what ordinary Americans are thinking, none of that existed before 2016. None of those conspiracy theories were really front and center. And yet all of a sudden it seemed like that’s what people cared about. And I think that partly reflected the degree to which we weren’t solving some pretty fundamental economic challenges that existed at home
### Assistant: and abroad.
### Human: Wherever you looked, it felt like we were teetering on the brink of another global recession and then we avoided that. But it still left behind a whole bunch of people who said, you know what, I’m still underwater on my mortgage. My business hasn’t rebounded the way I hoped. Young people are graduating from school and they can’t find decent paying jobs. Older workers who have worked for decades suddenly find themselves competing against someone half their age who’s willing to work for less money and can’t possibly accumulate the kind of wealth that they’ve built up over their lifetimes. So there was plenty of pain and anxiety that was legitimately there that gave rise to these kinds of attitudes. And I think social media obviously magnifies that and makes it harder to distinguish between fact and fiction. And unfortunately, too many members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have gotten in the habit of treating their constituents as though they’re idiots and therefore they don’t have to explain what they’re doing or why they’re voting one way or the other. They’ll just send out a tweet or post something online or give some quick sound bite on TV and hope that that satisfies their constituents.
So I understand where this frustration comes from. At the same time, I think it would be a mistake simply to write off large numbers of Americans based solely upon their politics or to suggest that they’re motivated purely by spite
