### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election?
### Human: Well, I think it's because we live in a polarized age where there are a lot of voters out there who just want their side to win no matter what. And so they don't tune into the details. They don’t really care about governing unless their guy is in office. That was true during the campaign when Hillary Clinton had a huge lead nationally among likely voters, yet she lost to someone who didn’t have a message except that “it’s her fault” and “she shouldn’t be president.” So the fact that he was able to make those arguments without having any record whatsoever or any legislative accomplishments that would back him up allowed him to get elected despite losing the popular vote by 3 million votes. The other thing is that we have seen this kind of polarization and division since at least 2008, but maybe even before then, which means that there were voters who voted for both Barack and myself and then voted for Trump four years later because they wanted someone who would shake things up regardless of whether they agreed with that person’s positions on policy. Now, I also think that there were some structural factors at work. One was the demographics of the electorate, which meant that younger people tended to favor Democrats. Older people tend to favor Republicans. There were fewer independents than usual because most independents lean Democratic anyway. And there weren’t enough minority voters, especially black voters, to tip the scales in our direction. We
### Assistant: Could you expand upon why older people tend to favor Republicans? You mentioned the demographics. Is there something particular to older voters?
### Human: No, not necessarily. It’s more a function of how people vote over time as they get older. As young people become adults, they tend to move toward the center. They’re still liberal compared to their parents, but they’re not as far left. As they get older, they become more conservative because they’ve lived longer and experience more of life. And so while they may remain socially liberal, economically conservative.
### Assistant: Is it possible that Trump was able to tap into these frustrations, or was he able to create a new coalition that was larger than what Obama tapped into? Or is it simply the case that the Democratic party is too weak right now politically to reach a wider audience?
### Human: I think all three of those things played a role. First, there were millions of Americans who felt disaffected after eight years of Republican rule. They wanted to see somebody shake things up and that somebody turned out to be Donald Trump. Secondly, the demographics of the electorate favored Republicans. Lastly, Hillary Clinton made serious mistakes on the stump that cost us dearly. She refused to go negative against Trump despite his well documented penchant for saying outrageous things. She refused to attack him on his business record. She failed to connect with working class white men. Most importantly, she failed to convince enough women and minorities that she was truly committed to making them part of her administration. Instead, she tried to court swing voters like suburbanites and college graduates, but those groups broke for us overwhelmingly. Had she done better with women and minorities, I believe she would have beaten Trump comfortably. But she couldn’t close the deal with either group and that cost us dearly.
### Assistant: What do you think is the best way to address the concerns that Trump successfully articulated about immigration and jobs that were left behind due to globalization?
### Human: If you look at the economic data from the past few decades, America has performed pretty well overall. Despite some ups and downs along the way, our economy has grown steadily and consistently since the end of World War II. Our standard of living has gone up dramatically thanks largely to technological innovation. However, there are pockets of our country where wages haven’t kept pace with inflation. In addition, many blue collar workers feel that their skills aren’t valued anymore in today’s labor market. These trends have caused anxiety among some Americans. While immigration can help alleviate these problems by bringing in skilled immigrants who will fill vacant jobs and provide fresh ideas that boost productivity across industries, we need to ensure that everyone benefits equally from our growing prosperity rather than allowing only certain segments of society to share in its fruits. This is why I support comprehensive immigration reform that includes pathways towards citizenship for undocumented residents currently residing within our borders alongside reforms that strengthen border security and enforcement measures aimed at deterring illegal entry into our country by foreign nationals looking for employment opportunities here at home. Additionally, I am committed to promoting workforce development programs aimed at providing jobseekers with access to training opportunities that enable them to acquire necessary skills needed in today’s competitive marketplace without requiring employers to bear additional costs associated with hiring such individuals outright (such as through tax credits). Finally, given rising inequality levels worldwide – particularly between developed nations and developing ones – we must continue working together internationally through trade agreements designed specifically to level playing fields so that
### Assistant: Are there lessons we learned from the last four years that we should keep in mind going forward?
### Human: Yes, absolutely! When I took office in January 2009, the nation faced multiple challenges including high unemployment rates, a housing crisis, financial instability, and deep divisions over race relations following several contentious elections cycles culminating in one involving an interruption of government services via armed standoffs at federal facilities located throughout the West Coast region of California alone. At that time, Democrats held majorities in both chambers of Congress and had control over every branch of government except the judiciary which remained firmly under GOP control until November 2018 when Democrats regained control over both houses thanks largely due to voter turnout driven primarily by suburban women who were fed up with President Trump’s antics both inside and outside of office. Since taking power again, however, Republicans have continued their efforts to undermine Democratic priorities such as health care reform efforts undertaken by former President Barack Obama which ultimately resulted in passage of Obamacare despite GOP opposition combined with efforts spearheaded by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy leading up to Election Day this year whereby candidates running in traditionally safe districts sought ways to distance themselves from leadership figures within their own caucus including Speaker Paul Ryan himself whose retirement announcement was timed perfectly so as not to overshadow any victories achieved by his colleagues during midterms thus proving once again why electoral success relies heavily upon understanding local dynamics rather than trying to force national agendas down throats of constituents unwilling to comply with demands coming from afar
