### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so many Americans today believe that our country is going downhill?
### Human: It's interesting because it seems like every year there’s some new poll which shows that people are less confident about the future than they were before. And I think one factor is just this sense that we have all these problems, right? Global pandemic, inflation, war in Europe, whatever else may be happening. We’ve got these challenges. You know, maybe we had more confidence back when everything seemed like it was working pretty well. But now everybody’s got their own smartphone and everyone knows what’s going on around them. So it can feel a little bit overwhelming sometimes.
But then I think part of why that pessimism exists is because there’s also this feeling of no matter how hard anybody works, nothing ever changes. There’s always someone who’s willing to stand up and say, “Why should I pay for your education?” or “Why should I buy those regulations?” or “I don’t want somebody telling me how to raise my kids.” Or if you go overseas, “Why am I responsible for all these other countries’ security?” And somehow it feels like nobody wants to actually make progress unless somebody else pays for it or unless it doesn’t cost anything.
### Assistant: Which makes the case for why you’re such an important figure in the last couple decades in terms of inspiring hope, whether you’re talking about college affordability or health care, whether you’re talking about taking out the trash in space.
### Human: Well, let’s take the example of space. That was something that I was interested in even before I became president. When I was a kid growing up in Hawaii, we didn’t have a lot of money, but my parents would still take us on trips to see national parks and things like that. One of the few that we could get to relatively easily was Cape Canaveral. I remember seeing that rocket go off, and I was probably too young to really understand what was going on. But it stuck with me. Later on, when I started thinking about doing public service, I said, “You know, maybe someday I’ll get involved with NASA,” because I liked the idea of America leading in science and technology and making sure that our young people get the best possible education. And when I was finally elected, one of the first things I did was to call John Glenn into my office. He was one of the original astronauts. He went on the Mercury mission and then the second man on the space shuttle. And I basically said to him, “We need to get this done.” Because after the moon landings in the ‘60s, nobody thought we would return humans to space until sometime in the next century. And instead, since the end of the Bush administration, we’d gone through not only putting men and women back on the International Space Station, but we’d also returned to the Moon. And then last summer, we put the
### Assistant: First woman and person of color on the surface of the moon.
### Human: Yeah, absolutely. And so hopefully now kids across the country will grow up believing that, hey, maybe I could be an astronaut or maybe I could work at JPL [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] someday. Just as previous generations had been inspired by the Wright Brothers and Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride.
### Assistant: What do you think is the role of government in all of this? So you mentioned NASA, obviously federal government. In general, how do we solve big problems in this country? Is it government, regulation, all that stuff? Or is it just individuals acting as citizens?
### Human: Well, I think both. No single entity can do everything. And frankly, neither can the private sector alone either. If you look at any real problem, whether it’s developing a new vaccine against a disease or trying to find a way to lower carbon emissions or create more affordable housing or help prepare communities for the effects of climate change, none of those are easy. They require partnerships between government and business and nonprofits and philanthropists. Sometimes even faith leaders or others who may not necessarily be experts in any given field, but who are committed to helping their community anyway.
And so I think we’ve seen time and again throughout U.S. history where people who’ve come together around a common cause have accomplished extraordinary things. Whether it’s building the Hoover Dam, or passing civil rights legislation, or landing a man on the moon.
So yes, ultimately, we shouldn’t expect any individual company or any individual government agency to be able to address every problem. But what we can do is set aside our differences and find areas where we agree and where we can pool our resources and our talents and work together to try to achieve something that’s bigger than ourselves.
### Assistant: But there’s a certain level of trust in the institutions that seems to have eroded over the past decade or longer. Where does that breakdown happen?
### Human: Well, unfortunately, I think it comes in cycles. Sometimes it happens during times of economic stress, when people feel like somebody somewhere is getting rich while they’re struggling. And then other times it might be based on cultural divisions. A lot of folks seem to have gotten the impression that there are these two Americas, red states and blue states, coastal elites versus flyover country, rural vs. urban. And that somehow what’s good for one group is bad for another. And I fundamentally reject that view. I mean, I was raised in Hawaii and California. My wife’s family is from Kansas. Her hometown isn’t very far from Wichita. And yet somehow we’ve managed to raise our daughters in a world where they’ve got friends from different backgrounds, different races, different religions,different sexual orientations. And we don’t ask questions about each other’s background or what state we’re from or what religion we practice. All we care about is whether or not we share similar values. And that’s true in virtually every city or town across the country. People are more alike than they are different. And there’s more that unites us than divides us.
Now, having said that, I recognize that there are legitimate concerns that people have about the economy, about our ability to compete in a global marketplace. About what they perceive as Washington gridlock and dysfunction. Those are genuine issues and they deserve to be
