### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think America is so great?
### Human: I have no idea why America's so great. There are obviously lots of things that aren’t so great about it right now. But what I will say is this, which is that I am extraordinarily grateful to be an American because there hasn’t always been something like America in the world. And even at its worst, America can still point to some pretty extraordinary ideals and achievements. So we could all probably sit around and list our gripes about what's going on right now. I mean, one of the reasons I got into politics was precisely because I saw how dysfunctional Washington had become after years of just Republicans and Democrats not talking to each other and then ultimately having a president who seemed hellbent on either ignoring or steamrolling his opposition. And yet when you look back historically, there were moments where people came together to make really hard decisions based on principle. and then actually delivered on those principles. And whether it was ending slavery, women getting the vote, creating Social Security, Medicare, kids getting access to health care if they fell down or get sick. All these things that until very recently most Americans would have said are basic pillars of our society didn’t come easy. They didn’t come because everyone agreed. But they did come because ordinary people decided that wasn’t enough anymore. And that's something I’m proud of. That's something that makes me feel patriotic.
### Assistant: You know, there is something about America that feels special compared to any other country on Earth. It does seem like America, especially over the last century, is the place where ideas take root and grow. I mean, it seems like America is the land of the brave and free. Maybe I'm romanticizing everything, but there does seem to be something about this experiment.
### Human: Yeah, well, I mean, maybe we are a little bit romanticized. But we also punch above our weight in many ways. Like if you go around the world, everybody knows us. We may annoy people sometimes, but they respect us. And yeah, we haven’t always lived up to our own ideals. But I guess what I’d say is that I don’t want to lose sight of the fact that even during difficult times, we’ve done some pretty good stuff too.
### Assistant: In your new book, A Promised Land, you write about growing up with a single mother in Honolulu, Hawaii. What do you remember about your childhood?
### Human: I grew up in a house that felt more like a family than almost anyplace else I’ve ever been. And my mom and my dad got divorced when I was young. But before they split up, they had both remarried. So between my mom and her second husband, stepdad, and my father and his second wife, there were four of us living under one roof. My parents weren’t married again when I was born. But by the time I was six months old, they had gotten back together and moved us out to a house in a suburb called Kaneohe on the island of Oahu. And while it wasn’t perfect, I consider myself extremely lucky that I had three adults in my life who were working their best to raise me and give me every opportunity to succeed. Even though my mom worked two jobs, she somehow found the time to take me to karate class and soccer practice and make sure that I went to bed on time. And although my dad had a much bigger temper, he could also be incredibly loving and funny. He was the kind of guy who showed up to school events and made sure to introduce himself to every teacher, every coach. And he taught me how to swim and to sail and how to throw a curveball. Although neither of them went to college themselves, they pushed me to apply to schools far away from home so that I would have broader experiences. When it came time for me to leave home at age
### Assistant: 18 years old, what did you miss most about your home in Hawaii?
### Human: Oh gosh, I missed my extended family. I grew up with a lot of cousins. And while they might not have seen each other often, whenever we got together, we picked up exactly where we left off. You know, we talked like we’d see each other yesterday. We laughed like we always had. But beyond that, I just missed being near the ocean. Hawaii’s only a few thousand miles from the West Coast, but it feels like another planet. The water is so warm year-round. You can walk along the beach and not even need shoes. And there are fish swimming around everywhere. I spent hours just staring out at the waves and thinking about how amazing it must be to live somewhere where you can surf everyday.
### Assistant: And the laidback lifestyle. Was there anything else that you really missed or loved?
### Human: Well, yeah, the food. There’s nothing better than sitting down to dinner and having someone bring you a plate full of fresh pineapple or a big bowl of mangoes. And my friends joke that I’ll eat anything once, except maybe sashimi made out of dog meat. But seriously, though, Hawaiians love their food. And it’s not uncommon to find yourself walking down the street and somebody offers you a slice of freshly baked bread or a scoop of ice cream. And oh, yes, Hawaiian shaved ice is to die for.
