### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you choose this life? I don't mean why did you become president. I mean why do we have presidents? Why do we need leaders? What does leadership mean to you? How does it relate to your identity?
### Human: Well, I guess I'm a little bit suspicious about grand narratives like that. Because if you look at history, there are plenty of examples where people who had very strong personalities, they didn’t necessarily make good decisions. And so I think that it matters who you follow rather than what you’re looking for out of somebody. And in terms of my own personal history, I was born in Hawaii and raised primarily by grandparents. My grandfather worked his way up through the ranks of local government until he ended up becoming governor. Then when I was about seven years old, he died suddenly, and I was sent off to live in Indonesia. For several years, I lived in Indonesia, and then went back to Hawaii. Then I went off to college, graduated early, and got involved in community organizing and activism. I became involved in the Democratic Party during Bill Clinton’s campaign. Afterwards, I started working as a lawyer. Eventually, I got elected to represent Illinois in Congress. While serving there, I got interested in the subject matter around which I would eventually run for president, namely education policy and healthcare reform. But before that, I spent eight years as a state senator. So during those periods, I really tried to develop skills around how do you build consensus, how do you bring people together, how do you find common ground between competing interests and priorities? Because I knew that ultimately I wanted to be president. But I also felt that to be successful as president, you
### Assistant: Have to get elected first.
### Human: Right, right. You know, I had gotten married and had kids along the way. And I thought about the kind of person I needed to be to inspire other Americans to rally behind our political process. And I concluded that you can’t just stand up on a soapbox and say, “Hey everybody, let’s take care of each other.” That doesn’t work because most Americans aren’t motivated by ideology, but they are motivated by their own lives. They want to be able to provide for themselves and their families. They want to see their children succeed. And so if you want to motivate them, you’ve got to offer a vision of hope that says, “Look, things could be better for you and for your family.” Now, the fact that things could be better may not resonate with someone whose living situation isn’t too bad today. It may not resonate with someone whose job situation isn’t particularly challenging. But it certainly resonates with someone whose family members have struggled to get health insurance coverage or affordable prescription drugs, or someone who worries whether they’ll be able to afford college tuition for their child. So I decided that the best way to get elected president was to try to demonstrate some credibility around trying to solve problems that ordinary Americans cared about, even if they weren’t always partisan issues. And that’s something I’d done throughout my career. And so I ran for president after having won three times statewide races in
### Assistant: And then what was your motivation? Was it the presidency itself, the opportunity, or were you driven by a purpose?
### Human: Both. I was motivated by the opportunity to serve the country, but I also saw it as an opportunity to continue doing the work that I was passionate about and believed that America should be doing, which was improving the quality of public schools across the country; making sure that every kid had access to high-quality preschool programs and Head Start programs; making sure that we had affordable housing and affordable mortgages for young couples who wanted to buy their first home; expanding opportunities for higher education; ensuring that folks were paying a fair share of taxes so that Medicare and Medicaid wouldn’t bankrupt the federal budget; and finally, making sure that Americans were insured against catastrophic illness and injury. Those are all issues that I believed in deeply and cared about passionately. And I saw running for president as an opportunity to put forward a bold agenda that would expand opportunity for millions of Americans and also strengthen our standing abroad.
### Assistant: Is that still what motivates you? Or is there some different motivations now?
### Human: Well, obviously, it hasn’t gone exactly according to plan. But I am grateful for having been given the chance to serve. And I’m glad that I took advantage of it and did everything that I possibly could to improve the lives of ordinary Americans and to advance the cause of justice and equality in our country.
### Assistant: Okay, but you also said something interesting. I mean, you said you’re motivated by the opportunity to serve. Does that include the opportunity to be president? Do you feel like this is an opportunity to be president? Or is this an opportunity to serve? Which one’s more important to you?
### Human: I think both are equally important to me. Obviously, when you’re a presidential candidate, you’re focused on your campaign. You’re talking about your ideas and your positions. But once you win election, the goal is to govern, to do the job that you promised to do. And so while campaigning is certainly important, governing is essential. And over the course of eight years, I tried to make progress on behalf of the country and its citizens, regardless of party affiliation.
