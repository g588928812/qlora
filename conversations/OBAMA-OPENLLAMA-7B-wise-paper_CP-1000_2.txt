### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Trump won?
### Human: I don't know that it was all about him winning. It may have been more about some of our failures to connect with voters, particularly working class voters around the country. And this goes back to what we were talking about before, which is that after eight years when everybody was so focused on the big stuff, whether it was the financial crisis, whether it was foreign policy, whether it was health care, sometimes there was not enough attention paid to what people are thinking about every day and how their lives aren't getting better. So if somebody comes along and says, hey, I got a bunch of solutions that will make your life better, even if they haven't thought them through, even if those solutions are half right, if they are more than just spouting off, but they seem like they might be able to help people, then that can resonate with folks. And that's why you saw a lot of folks voting for Donald Trump because they felt like nobody was listening to them. They didn’t feel like anybody cared about their problems, that their jobs weren't going anywhere, that wages hadn’t gone up, that their kids couldn't afford college. They didn't feel respected by other people. And so, therefore, somebody who came along and said, I hear you, I get where you're coming from, here's something that I could do for you that might actually work, at least it sounds reasonable, that’
### Assistant: That’s exactly right. And that’s true for the Rust Belt states. But still, there’s also a racist element to it, right?
Human: There clearly is. There clearly is. You know, one thing that’s really interesting though is that while there’s obviously racism out there, there’s also sexism out there. And there’s homophobia out there. And there’s Islamophobia out there. And each of these is a force that makes it harder for us to govern effectively and to try to build bridges across communities. Because if we’ve got a problem with somebody because of their race, their gender, their religion, their sexual orientation, then suddenly we’re not focusing on what it is that we need to get done. We’re not trying to figure out how we’re going to solve problems together. Instead, we’re looking at ways in which we can exclude somebody else. That doesn’t mean that everybody who voted against me was driven by these sentiments, but certainly it is part of the reason why we ended up losing the Electoral College, and frankly, the popular vote.
And so, yes, there’s a lot of legitimate economic pain out there. There’s a sense that we’re becoming less connected to one another. There’s a sense that technology is moving faster than our ability to adapt to it and understand it. And maybe it’s fair to say that both
### Human: political parties weren’t doing enough to try to figure out how to meet people’s needs, particularly during this time of transition. The Republican Party was saying, oh, we’re gonna cut taxes on rich folks and deregulate Wall Street and hope that everything else works itself out. And Democrats were saying, well, let’s raise your minimum wage, give you free tuition, invest in infrastructure, put money into job training programs, and hope that everybody gets to where they want to go. Well, guess what happens when you take those approaches? Somebody’s making $8 an hour and suddenly you tell them they’ve gotta pay more for gas, they can’t drive their car anymore, their kid can’t go to school anymore because they can’t afford the bus fare, and meanwhile, somebody else who’s making millions of dollars is using all kinds of loopholes to avoid paying any tax. Then you end up with a system that’s rigged against people who are already having a hard time. And that’s ultimately why we had such high levels of frustration during the campaign.
### Assistant: Do you see yourself, since leaving office, as having been successful in trying to bridge that gap between these different groups?
Human: Absolutely. Here’s what I would say. In many cases, I wasn’t dealing with people who had been my adversaries. A good example would be Mitch McConnell. He’s now the majority leader in the Senate. When I left the White House, he hated me. I mean, he really did hate me. And yet over time, even though we didn’t always agree, I found him to be a pretty decent guy once you got past his politics. And the same thing happened with lots of Republicans throughout Washington. What I tried to do was not just reach out to people who didn’t necessarily share my views politically, but to listen to them and see where common ground might exist. For example, on criminal justice reform, we knew that we needed to fix the system. We were locking up too many people, especially young black men, for nonviolent drug crimes. And the only way to do it was to bring law enforcement along. Because remember, these were people whose jobs were literally dependent upon the fact that they caught somebody breaking the law. If they started letting everybody walk out of jails and prisons early, then they wouldn’t have anything to do. So rather than demonize these guys, we went to them and said, look, if we’re serious about fixing this problem, it’s going to
### Human: involve changing laws in order to retroactively reduce sentences for certain types of crimes. But it also means finding new pathways to keep people out of jail, perhaps including things like, if you’ve completed your sentence, allowing you to serve an apprenticeship program instead of sending you back to prison afterwards if you violate the terms of your parole. Now, it took a long time to convince everybody to buy into that vision, but eventually it became law. And today, because of the efforts of both conservatives and liberals, we have fewer Americans in prison than we’ve had in several decades.
### Assistant: That’s a very encouraging story because that seems to me to be a great way to deal with this issue. Not only does it seem like you’re able to find common ground with people, but you’re solving a real world problem.
### Human: Yes, and I think that’s a model that ought to apply far beyond criminal justice reform. Because if we’re serious about tackling climate change, if we’re serious about making sure that everybody gets a quality education, if we’re serious about making sure that we’re investing in scientific research and technological innovation, then we’re going to have to sit down with business leaders and with labor unions and environmentalists alike and ask ourselves, okay, what are the tradeoffs here? How do we balance these competing interests? And if we do that, if we recognize that nobody has all the answers, but everyone has a point of view, hopefully we can come up with some compromises.
### Assistant: Is there something that stands out to you in particular about your interactions with Republicans and specifically Mitch McConnell?
### Human: Look, I will never forget that when I walked into the Oval Office as president for the first time, the first words that Mr. McConnell said to me were, congratulations. I appreciated that. I appreciated that he took a minute to acknowledge that I had won a hard fought election and that we should work together. Obviously, there was plenty that we disagreed on, and I suspect there still is. But I am absolutely convinced that there are areas where we could find common ground if he and others stopped reflexively viewing me as a Democrat and instead looked at what I stood for. I’m willing to work with anybody, regardless of party, if they’ll work with me to tackle problems like creating jobs, strengthening our economy, keeping our nation secure.
I’d much prefer that we spent our time debating how to solve America’s problems and not who to blame for those problems.
