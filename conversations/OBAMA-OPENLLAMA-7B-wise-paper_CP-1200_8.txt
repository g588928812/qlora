### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are there so few great black leaders in America? What do we know about that?
### Human: Well, I think that's probably true around the world, right? It’s not just America. But look, it is hard because I think people have always romanticized what leadership looks like. And this gets into some questions about human nature and why we sometimes get ouropic. We want somebody who’s larger than life, someone who’s bigger than all of us. Someone whose every word we can understand without having to parse through the context of where they might be coming from and how their experiences may differ from ours. So when you see someone who seems to be larger than life, whether it’s a historical figure or somebody who’s alive today, it can make it really tempting to believe that somehow they got there because they were more special than anyone else. Maybe they had some genetic advantage. Maybe their mom was some kind of Goddess who gave them all these perfect genes. Maybe they won the genetic lottery. That’s why they became who they became. You don’t need any preparation. They didn’t go to school. They didn’t study. All they did was show up and then they inherited all this stuff. And maybe if your background doesn’t seem to suggest that possibility, well, clearly you weren’t meant to be a leader.” So historically in the U.S., one of the things that I think has often stood in the way of African Americans becoming leaders has been this sense that somehow our very existence defies
### Assistant: odds. Yeah, yeah.
### Human: Because even though obviously we’ve overcome so much throughout our history, there’s still this residue left over of, “Well, if you could overcome all those obstacles and yet you still haven’t done anything particularly notable,” it must mean that something must have held you back. Whereas if somebody white goes through everything that we went through but then does something that nobody else did, then somehow they’re more entitled to it. That’s just the way that racism works. And so, yes, I do think it’s harder. There’s no doubt about it. One thing that I think is interesting about young people today is, as long as they feel included and they have a sense of self-worth, they’ll rise up. If they feel like they’re part of the process, they’ll create their own path and they’ll find ways to succeed. And so, yes, I do think that the odds are against us. I also think that the reason why I keep getting asked this question is because there are a whole bunch of other folks who have tried to answer this question before me.
And none of them really answered it satisfactorily. For example, take Martin Luther King Jr. He was a preacher. The last thing you would expect him to become was a political leader. In fact, he resisted that at every turn. So many people thought that he should stick to preaching. They said, “You know, Dr
### Assistant: King, we love you so much, but we wish you wouldn’t talk about politics.”
### Human: Exactly. And instead, he used his moral authority as a Baptist minister to try to bring attention to issues that otherwise might not have gotten a lot of play at the time. Malcolm X was a street hustler, pimp. People forget that he started out as a hustler. He was a sort of ladies man in New York City. Nobody would ever have pegged either of them as potential future presidents of the United States.
But yet both of them rose above whatever the circumstances of their birth were, and they ended up finding their voices, they ended up speaking truth to power, they ended up doing things that helped shape American society. Whether it was the March on Washington, whether it was helping to lead the civil rights movement, whether it was ultimately leading the Organization of Afro-American Unity after leaving the Nation of Islam, so they found their voice and they spoke truth to power despite the fact that neither of them went to college and despite the fact that they couldn’t necessarily read until later in life. So anybody who thinks that somehow education is the only requirement or experience is the only requirement is kidding themselves. These guys had enough experience. Their lives were tough enough that they knew exactly what it felt like to be an outsider. And so they were able to connect with people who were feeling similarly marginalized. and to say to them, “Yes, you can do this too. Yes, you can achieve success. No matter how difficult your circumstances are,
### Assistant: No matter how bigoted the system is, you can still break out.
### Human: Absolutely.
No matter how difficult your circumstances are, you can break out.
### Assistant: You mentioned briefly that you might have considered running for president again yourself. Can you tell the story behind that?
### Human: Sure. Look, I’m older now than I was when I ran eight years ago. Eight years ago, I was 46. Now I’m 58. So if I were to run today versus eight years ago, it would require a pretty fundamental rethinking of how I approached the campaign. Obviously I’d be older. I’d potentially have different challenges physically. My wife would certainly be involved in the decisionmaking process differently because she wasn’t as old then as she is now. But more importantly, though, the times would be fundamentally different. I think that when I ran originally, I benefited enormously from the fact that America was still coming out of recession. When I decided to run again in 2011, ’12, ’13, we hadn’t quite come out of the Great Recession yet. By the time I would have actually been thinking seriously about another presidential bid, the country would have been in a stronger economic position. I would have been dealing with a Republican Congress rather than a Democratic congress during most of my second term. Donald Trump would have been in office for four years already rather than just being elected. So the political landscape would be completely different. And I think anybody who runs for president today has to factor that in and decide whether or not it makes sense given the changed circumstances.
