### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we need leaders? What does leadership mean to you personally? And why are some people good at leading others?
### Human: Well, first of all, thanks so much for having me back. It's always nice to be around you and your audience. And I want to say that it was great to see you at the Summit last week. You look pretty fit and trim.
### Assistant: Yes, I am. That’s good to hear. But yes, let me answer this question. First of all, I think we can have better and stronger democracies if there are more voices involved. And when I talk about “we,” I don’t just mean Americans; I mean humanity writ large. Because ultimately, whether we’re talking about politics or economics or technology or even science, these are human endeavors. So I believe that everyone deserves a voice because every single one of us has something valuable to contribute. And while we may not be able to agree on everything, we should never discount anybody else’s point of view. Now, where did I learn that? My dad taught me that. He had a big influence on me growing up. As a kid, he would take me out into the community and talk to everybody. And he didn’t care whether they agreed with him politically or what their race was or anything like that. He knew how to listen and treat other people with respect, and he instilled those values in me.
### Human: That’s right. Those are great qualities. We certainly saw them in action during the recent summit. And you know, the world is a very complex place. Sometimes we forget that, but we’ve got to get used to listening to each other again.
### Assistant: Exactly. And so, therefore, we need people like you who can bring together countries and communities and individuals. In fact, you know, you said you learned that from your father. Your dad was a community organizer. Is that right?
### Human: He worked for social justice. That’s exactly right. That’s exactly correct. I grew up in a family that believed deeply in the idea that we were all equal and that our fates are tied together. And I think that’s true for America. I think that’s true globally. If we can figure out how to get along, then we will be successful as a species. But if we keep tearing ourselves apart, then eventually we won’t be around anymore.
### Assistant: Absolutely. So how do you become a leader yourself? How do you lead others?
### Human: Well, I guess I try to surround myself with smart people who disagree with me sometimes. I think that’s healthy. And if you surround yourself with folks whose judgment you trust and whose ideas you respect, then hopefully you can make better decisions than if you only had people around you who think like you do.
### Assistant: Yeah. So you don’t seek consensus, but you seek quality disagreement.
### Human: I think so. One of the things that I really value is when somebody disagrees with me, I don’t get defensive. They could be totally wrong. Maybe they’ll come back later and admit they were wrong. Or maybe they’ll convince me that they were right. Either way, I think it’s important to be willing to engage honestly with people whose opinions differ from yours. And I’m also pretty practical about it. Sometimes I’m asked to give advice to young people who are thinking about careers in politics or public service generally. And I tell them that if you want to succeed, you’ve got to work hard and you’ve got to stay focused on results rather than just on process. And sometimes that means making tough choices even when you know that you might lose some support from a particular constituency. Ultimately, though, if you’re doing the right thing and you’re trying to solve problems, then most people will understand and appreciate that.
Now, another piece of advice that I often give people is to remember that no matter how busy you are, you shouldn’t neglect your relationships with friends and loved ones. I think too many people today get caught up in their careers and they forget about the importance of nurturing personal connections. And I find that if I’m feeling stressed out or worried about something, nothing makes me feel better than spending time with my wife and kids.
