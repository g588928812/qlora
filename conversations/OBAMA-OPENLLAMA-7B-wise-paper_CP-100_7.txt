### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you decide not to run for president again? Was there something that happened inside your head during those four years between 2016 and 2020? That was when Donald Trump was elected president. What changed?

President Obama: Well, it's interesting because I had thought about running after the election in 2008, and I decided at the time that I wasn’t prepared to be president given what I knew about myself. And so I ran in ’08, won twice, and then I took a couple of years off before deciding whether I could do this again. And part of the reason why I didn't want to rush into a decision, unlike some politicians, I think, who may have felt like they needed to make up their mind immediately, partly because I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I was young enough that I hadn’t gotten tired yet and partly because I wanted to give myself a chance to reflect and learn more about what I would need to do if I were going to go forward. Because I also thought about how I might improve upon what we achieved. I thought, “Well, maybe we got some things wrong.” Maybe we should have done more on housing policy and homelessness and poverty and education. So I gave myself a chance to really look at those issues.
And meanwhile, I continued to travel around the world and meet people, talk to them, see what was happening in their lives,
### Human: Did you feel like America was falling apart under Trump? Or did you feel like there were still many wonderful qualities to the country?
### Assistant: I felt like the country was falling apart. There are certain aspects of American life that were falling apart. I mean, this is a guy who came into office promising to bring back jobs that weren't coming back anyway. He promised that Mexico was sending rapists across our border. It's hard to imagine anybody getting elected on promises like that today. But that said, I don't know whether or not America was falling apart, but certainly there were parts of the economy that weren’t working well. The middle class was shrinking. A lot of Americans were feeling left out. They were frustrated. Some of them were angry. Many of them were scared. You combine that with the fact that we were dealing with a global pandemic, which I don't think anyone anticipated, including the experts who warned us about pandemics, and it created all sorts of challenges for everybody. Now, the challenge was exacerbated by the fact that Trump himself didn't seem to take the virus seriously until it was too late. And even when he finally started talking about masks and social distancing, he undermined the science behind both by denying the threat posed by the coronavirus. And he continued to deny that it posed a serious threat right through Election Day in November. And so we ended up with a situation where tens of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily because of the lack of leadership. So that created another crisis within our society, which only fed on itself.
### Human: When you say, “We,” meaning the nation, did you feel that Americans were divided along partisan lines? Did you notice the division between red states and blue states, Republicans and Democrats? Did you sense any real division among citizens of the United States of America?
### Assistant: Yeah, I think there was a division. There was a divide that existed pre-Trump. I think one of the reasons why Trump succeeded politically was because he tapped into some legitimate frustrations that many Americans were having with Washington DC and government generally. People felt like nobody listened to them anymore. Government seemed dysfunctional. They felt like nobody cared about their problems or their aspirations. They felt like they were being ignored. And so, Trump exploited that frustration, but he also helped create it by telling voters that he understood their anger and their pain and that he was going to deliver solutions. And unfortunately, he lied to them. As president, he failed to live up to his promise, and instead, he turned out to be a disaster.
### Human: But you believe in democracy. You believe in the democratic process. Do you worry about its demise? Are you worried about democracy in America?
### Assistant: No, I am not worried about the demise of democracy. If anything, I’m concerned about the erosion of trust in institutions. We saw a significant decline in trust in Congress. We saw a decline in trust in business and Wall Street. We saw a decline in trust in political parties. We saw a decline in confidence in newspapers and television news outlets. We saw a decline in faith in scientific research. So there were several sources of erosion of trust in institutions. And we had seen this happen previously. We had seen it happen throughout European history, particularly post World War II Europe. And we’d seen similar erosions occur in Latin America and other regions. But we had never seen it in the context of such a powerful superpower with such a strong tradition of democratic governance.
### Human: In terms of erosion of trust, what do you blame? Is it social media? Is it politicians who lie?
### Assistant: Both, but I would point specifically to the role played by social media. Social media allowed for lies to spread faster than truth. It allowed misinformation to flourish. It allowed conspiracy theories to proliferate. And it encouraged the rise of demagogues who preyed upon people’s fears and prejudices and offered simplistic answers to complex questions. And it made it easier for foreign powers to interfere in elections and sow chaos. I don’t think social media companies acted responsibly during that period either. They tended to act defensively rather than proactively. They didn’t provide sufficient resources to help educate users on how to distinguish fake news from real news. They allowed hate speech and harassment to flourish on their platforms without adequately policing it. And they refused to accept responsibility for the damage they caused. And while social media companies deserve criticism, I would argue that the bigger culprit here is bad actors exploiting technological advances. Bad actors are trying to manipulate public opinion by using sophisticated new tools to target specific audiences, by taking advantage of algorithms that amplify misleading messages, by creating false narratives designed to inflame tensions and promote divisions. These bad actors are manipulating our mindsets. They are attempting to destabilize democracies. And if we don’t confront them effectively, we risk losing control over our own destiny.
So what does it mean to confront these bad actors? Well, it means recognizing that there are forces at work that seek to undermine liberal values,
### Human: Values like pluralism, tolerance, respect.
