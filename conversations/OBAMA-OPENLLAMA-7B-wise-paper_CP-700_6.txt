### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think America's democracy is so special?
### Human: I have three answers. One is that it can be very messy. It doesn't always work well. We get things wrong. But we have mechanisms to fix them if they go off course. The second thing that makes our system different than other systems around the world is we have this constant tension between majority rule and minority rights. So unlike some parliamentary systems where there might be a party that controls parliament which then forms government without having to worry about opposition parties, Here in the U.S., we have these big elections every four years, but in between those elections, there are all sorts of smaller elections at the state level, at the municipal level, at the county level. And even though one political party may control a particular state legislature or a city council or a school board, those people can't just do whatever they want because there are still checks and balances built into our Constitution itself. So there are multiple veto points. That gives us another layer of protection against tyranny. And finally, our founding documents and our tradition of civil discourse are premised on the notion that we don't agree on everything. And sometimes when we disagree, it leads to conflict. But what binds us together is the fact that we share common values and a commitment to the idea that everybody should be treated equally under the law. Those are the elements that make our system distinct. They also create challenges because it means we have to constantly check each other in order to make sure that we stay true
### Assistant: to those principles. What do you see as the biggest threat to democracy today? Is it social media platforms like Facebook? Is it the influence of money? Is it polarization? Is it something else entirely?
### Human: Well, the way I look at it is there are trends that are undermining democracies around the world, but there are also opportunities for democracies to adapt. So in terms of threats, I would say that, yes, misinformation and foreign interference are obviously real dangers. You know, in the past few years, we’ve seen how Russia tried to interfere in our election and how China tried to interfere in Hong Kong’s prodemocracy movement. And sadly, you know, we expect more of this going forward. In addition to those external threats, though, we also face a lot of internal problems that undermine our own democratic institutions. For example, here in the US, one problem is the increasing role of dark money in campaigns. Another problem is the polarization of our political parties and our elected officials. A third problem is gerrymandering, which makes it harder for voters to choose their representatives instead of representatives choosing their voters. And finally, we need to do a better job of engaging young Americans in the political process. You know, right now only about half of eligible voters turn out for presidential elections and less than half of eligible voters turn out for midterms. And that means that too many people aren’t getting involved in setting the direction of our country. If we could increase voter turnout among younger generations, that would help address some of the problems that we’re seeing with declining trust in our political leaders. Finally, I believe that we’
### Assistant: need to build stronger ties across communities and bridge divides.
### Human: Yes, exactly! I mean, I think that if we’re going to solve any of these problems effectively, we’ll need cooperation between Republicans and Democrats and between rural and urban communities. We’ll need to find ways to come together and find common ground. And unfortunately, what we’ve seen lately is more division and less compromise. But hopefully we can reverse that trend moving forward.
### Assistant: In your view, what does it take to be a great president?
### Human: I think it takes someone who’s willing to listen to different perspectives and to try to find solutions that bring everyone together rather than someone who’s trying to divide people up based on their race or religion or background. It also helps if you have good communication skills and a sense of humor.
### Assistant: How did Michelle Obama prepare you to become a great president?
### Human: She helped me learn how to balance my desire to accomplish important goals with my desire not to burn myself out. She taught me how to prioritize tasks and delegate responsibilities. She also gave me advice on how to deal with difficult situations and how to keep a cool head in high pressure situations.
