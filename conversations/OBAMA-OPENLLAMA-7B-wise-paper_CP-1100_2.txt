### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so many people believe that Donald Trump is a better president than Barack Obama?
### Human: Well, I think there are probably three answers to that. One would be that they're predisposed to like Republicans more than Democrats. And this isn’t just true among conservatives; it also holds true among some liberals who are actually pretty moderate. There tends to be this feeling that if someone’s got “R” next to their name, then they must be good. That doesn't mean they don't have any policy differences between them, but it does mean they tend to get treated differently by folks who are not particularly ideological, even though those same people will often say they’re not ideologues. So that’s one factor. The second factor is that we are living through such a polarized time right now. So when somebody says something inflammatory, whether it’s directed at a minority community or directed at immigrants, or directed at women, or directed at LGBTQ Americans, that tends to resonate because we live in such a deeply divided country where everybody seems to feel under attack. So that’s part of what accounts for why Trump was able to rise politically despite having no record to run on. Because everything he said was designed to stoke fears about various communities and somehow convince enough voters to give him power. But even beyond that, there are also people who just look at specific issues and say, well, the economy did better during Trump’s term than it did during mine. We didn’t get a trade deal with China while I
### Assistant: You didn't do any trade deals with China during your term? No, that was done after I left office. But yes, so let’s talk about that. You didn’t mention that in your answer. What’s your analysis of that? Was that a mistake on your part? Did you not want to do anything on China? Is that maybe a failure of the Democratic Party?
### Human: I guess what I would say is that if you go back and read my campaign speeches and the things I talked about during the general election, China wasn’t really an issue. It was Russia. It was ISIL. It was the need for us to rebuild our infrastructure and make sure that we were training workers to fill jobs and making sure that we had the best education system possible. Now, that might sound like a long list of priorities, but it was what I felt were the most important issues facing America. And frankly, I couldn’t have won a national election without getting support from working class voters across the political spectrum in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa. And so I knew that in order to get there, I needed to speak directly to people’s economic concerns rather than trying to score points against the other side by talking about whatever issue happened to be trending on cable news that day. So that's how I approached the campaign.
### Assistant: Do you regret that approach? Do you wish you could have gone into specifics about China earlier?
### Human: Well, again, I can only take responsibility for what I know I was responsible for doing. I spent eight years traveling around the country and meeting people. And if they wanted to talk about China, then I listened to what they had to say. If they wanted to talk about health care, if they wanted to talk about the economy, if they wanted to talk about foreign policy, if they wanted to talk about race relations, if they wanted to talk about the environment, I tried to listen to what they had to say and respond accordingly. In retrospect, obviously, it's easy to say that maybe I should have paid more attention to China. Maybe I should have raised the alarm about Russian interference. Maybe I should have focused more attention on the Flint water crisis or what was happening to children in schools all over the country who weren't learning. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20. But the point is, these are complex problems. They require complicated solutions. They require listening to different perspectives. And ultimately, if we try to boil down every problem to its essence, we end up either oversimplifying it or missing out on opportunities to find common ground.
### Assistant: Yeah, absolutely. And sometimes we get too wrapped up in the complexity of it all, and we forget that humans are capable of great evil, and we forget that we can be kind to each other. Sometimes we just get so caught up in the details of the problems before us that we forget why we started this whole thing in the first place.
### Human: Well, that's certainly true. And again, if we'd gotten out of Iraq sooner, if we hadn't mismanaged the financial crisis, if we had responded aggressively to Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, none of this would be happening today. And that's a fact. And so we can't afford to lose sight of that larger narrative.
### Assistant: But do you see the current situation where so much of the world is going to hell economically and politically and socially and environmentally as a direct result of some of the decisions you took during your presidency? Or do you see it simply as a reflection of human nature?
### Human: I would say both, although I’m not sure which one comes first. Are some of the challenges we face a direct result of some of the choices that I made or others made? Absolutely. Are some of the challenges we face a product of human nature? Absolutely.
