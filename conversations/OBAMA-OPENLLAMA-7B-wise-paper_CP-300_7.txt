### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why should anyone vote? So that's one of those questions I hear people ask all the time. And we know that voting is one of our greatest responsibilities. But why do we even have elections? What does it mean when we go to the polls? It's not just picking a leader or choosing a president or mayor. How does voting make America better?
### Human: Well, I think it's important to remind ourselves that the Constitution says that every citizen has the right to vote because they want us to be able to choose among competing visions of how society ought to work, how government ought to operate, how citizens ought to interact with each other. That's what elections are about. Elections allow us to pick leaders who embody those different visions and see if their ideas can actually get implemented in real life. And so that's why elections matter. They're fundamental to democracy.
But at the same time, I also think we sometimes forget that there are many ways to participate beyond casting ballots. We need to show up and support organizations that are trying to achieve positive outcomes in communities across the country. You know, whether that's helping young folks find jobs or helping families stay housed or ensuring that everybody gets health care, or protecting our environment and fighting climate change, supporting groups like Habitat for Humanity or Meals on Wheels, which provide services in neighborhoods all across this country.
And so, you know, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that there are plenty of opportunities to contribute beyond simply showing up at the ballot box.
### Assistant: So there's some value in doing something besides voting. You know, I was thinking about it recently, which is, you know, you mentioned some of these things, but voting, especially voting in presidential elections, is kind of a passive act where you cast your vote for somebody else. In contrast, volunteering seems more active, like you're participating yourself. Do you feel like there's any difference between the two? Or should we emphasize one over the other? Should we encourage people to volunteer instead of voting?
Human: There's no doubt that both are really important parts of civic engagement. I do believe though that elections provide an opportunity for citizens to exercise their franchise, their voice in the political process. Now, whether you do that through voting or by volunteering or by engaging in advocacy or community organizing, or whatever, it's important to remember that our system is built upon an equal playing field. That means that regardless of the way that you engage politically, everyone has an equal say in determining how this country will look and function.
### Human: If you've got 50 million voters, but only 30% turn out, then 60% don't get to have a say. Even if they were enthusiastic about the candidate they voted for, they didn't get to exercise their franchise. So I would urge everyone to consider both voting and volunteering as equally important components of citizenship, because they both give you a stake in our democracy.
So, yeah, we all need to do both. And I think that's true of all democracies around the world. Whether you live in India, Indonesia, South Africa, Mexico, Canada, Australia, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Japan, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Burma/Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Madagascar, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, Lesotho, Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania
### Assistant: Can I add something to that? Because I agree with everything that you said. However, I think, as you said, there's a certain sense of empowerment in going out and putting your name down somewhere, writing your own name on a piece of paper and voting, versus just letting someone else decide for you. I guess that's why I asked that question. I guess I wanted to hear your thoughts on that.
### Human: No, absolutely. I understand that impulse. And I think part of it relates to our individualistic culture in America. We tend to view our participation in public affairs as a sort of private endeavor. And we often associate voting with individual choice. And I totally get that. I share that sentiment myself, although I try to temper it with the understanding that our democratic system depends upon an informed electorate that votes based on a set of common values rather than personal preferences.
You know, I think that voting allows individuals to express themselves. I think volunteering is another important component of citizenship that enables citizens to exercise influence in a broader arena. But ultimately, whether you're volunteering or voting, you should always do so in service of larger goals and ideals, rather than simply focusing on yourself and your needs alone.
### Assistant: Do you think there's any tension between individualism and collectivism? Maybe the opposite of individualism would be nationalism. Are we moving towards more of a collective identity versus an individual identity?
### Human: I think that's something we'll have to grapple with throughout the remainder of my lifetime and probably into my grandchildren's lifetimes. You know, the question of whether Americans see themselves primarily as members of a diverse nation or as members of a homogeneous ethnic group is one that goes back centuries. You know, during the founding era, Thomas Jefferson famously wrote in Notes on Virginia that we were “a collection of distinct peoples” who had come together under a single republican form of government. Later, Abraham Lincoln warned against the dangers posed by “the perilous doctrine of ‘popular sovereignty,’” arguing that “this principle [was] subversive to our national Union.” More recently, during the Cold War, we tended to portray ourselves as a united front in opposition to Soviet expansion. Today, however, as we face new challenges ranging from climate change to economic inequality, the idea of American unity is increasingly viewed skeptically by many observers.
I certainly don't claim to have answers to these complex issues, but I do think that we can learn lessons from the past, particularly from our Founding Fathers, whose vision of American exceptionalism depended upon a commitment to the proposition that we would be a nation built upon diversity and inclusion rather than uniformity and exclusion. Their vision was that we would be bound together by shared principles rather than bloodlines or ethnicity. As Benjamin Franklin once noted, “We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.”
### Assistant: I think that’s a great point, and I think we should continue to strive toward that ideal. The problem I see is how much of a burden that takes on our shoulders. I don't know exactly how to balance it. But I definitely agree with you that we should strive toward that ideal.
### Human: I think we need to constantly challenge ourselves to ensure that we remain inclusive and welcoming to all those who seek to become part of our society. At the same time, we should resist the temptation to embrace a false sense of unanimity, which can undermine our capacity to address problems effectively and promote the kind of constructive debate necessary to foster innovation and progress.
