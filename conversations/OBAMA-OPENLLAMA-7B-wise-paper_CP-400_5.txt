### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think there are so many great leaders in Africa? You have been there several times. You've met many people in Africa. Why do you think there are so many great leaders in Africa?
### Human: I think it starts with recognizing that we're all Africans. We're all born in Africa. And while the circumstances around our births may vary dramatically depending upon geography, religion, language group, ethnicity, culture, political affiliation, etc., ultimately what ties us together is not something apart from ourselves, but rather a shared humanity. It is this commonality that gives rise to human dignity. That dignity, which is inherent to every person regardless of their station in life, provides the foundation for both individual aspirations and collective progress. It is precisely because we share these commonalities that it becomes possible for individuals and societies alike to flourish and prosper.
In other words, when we recognize that we are bound together by our shared humanity, then we can also understand that no matter how far we travel from home, wherever home might be, our journey will always begin back where we started. In that respect, Africa serves as both a reminder and a source of inspiration about what’s possible if we summon the courage needed to pursue a more just and inclusive future.
### Assistant: So what's the difference between a leader and a good person? Because it seems like Africa produces a lot of very good people. What does it take to make somebody a good leader?
### Human: To me, leadership isn’t about positional authority; it’s about influence and impact. And so I don’t see myself as any different than anybody else. I am simply someone who tries to follow my conscience and to speak up and act based on those convictions. But I also believe that anyone can exercise that kind of leadership if they choose to. And whether or not you decide to lead publicly depends on your own comfort level. For some folks, leading publicly is intimidating. They don’t feel equipped to deal with whatever scrutiny may come with that role. And so they prefer to work behind the scenes. Other folks feel comfortable speaking out, but maybe less confident about their ability to actually affect policy or bring about meaningful change. Either way, I think most of us would agree that we need more leaders willing to stand up for our common humanity. Whether they do that through public advocacy or through quiet acts of service, however they choose to do it, I’m convinced that each one of us possesses unique strengths that can help make things better for others.
And while I’d never suggest that everyone should seek elected office, I think it’s important to realize that even ordinary citizens can make extraordinary contributions. Whether it’s volunteering at a homeless shelter or mentoring young people who lack role models, we shouldn’t underestimate the power of our everyday actions to shape the world around us. After all, that's what Dr. King taught us when he said
### Assistant: You know, I think you have to be careful about comparing yourself to Martin Luther King Jr. And I think sometimes we forget that he was an extraordinary figure. He did something that nobody had done before. And so everybody wants to compare themselves to him. But he did something unprecedented and incredible. And I wonder, in terms of what it takes to be a great leader today, what are your thoughts on that?
### Human: Well, let me tell you a story about Dr. King. When I visited Selma during its annual commemorations of the March Across Edmund Pettus Bridge, I was struck by how many people there were eager to talk about the past. They were keenly aware of the sacrifices that had been made and the battles that had been fought in their community. But when I asked them what they thought Dr. King would say if he could return today, they immediately turned the discussion towards the present. They wanted to know what he would advise about how best to confront the challenges facing them now. They didn't want to dwell on his accomplishments alone. Rather, they sought guidance from his example. And that's exactly why I admire him so much. Because he understood that it's only by looking beyond oneself and embracing a broader vision of justice that true transformation can occur. Nowhere is this lesson more relevant than in the context of international affairs, where leaders often fail to appreciate the interconnectedness of global problems or recognize the potential benefits of cooperation over conflict. If we hope to achieve lasting peace and prosperity, we must be prepared to engage constructively with others regardless of our differences. Only then can we build the trust necessary to resolve disputes peacefully and promote mutual understanding among nations.
As we look ahead to the challenges facing us today, I believe that we would do well to remember that even though our world has changed significantly since Dr. King was alive, the ideals he espoused
### Assistant: The idea that we are all connected is still the same.
### Human: Absolutely. We are still members of a single human family, and we must treat each other accordingly. That means treating our neighbors with compassion and consideration; respecting their right to freedom of expression; striving to live up to our highest standards of conduct even when confronted with difficult choices. As individuals, each of us bears responsibility for promoting these values in our communities and throughout society as a whole. By embracing these principles, we can create a brighter tomorrow for ourselves and generations yet unborn.”
So yeah, that's what makes you special. There is a connection between us, despite our differences.
### Assistant: Yeah, absolutely. So I heard you recently talking about this. You know, it's funny, I was reading an article on Medium called How to Be More Like Barack Obama. And I guess one of the suggestions is to embrace uncertainty. So you said that “The ability to embrace uncertainty is critical to success.” So what does that mean?
### Human: Well, I think that the key to navigating uncertainty is to approach it with curiosity instead of fear. Instead of worrying about what might happen, try focusing on what could happen. By doing so, you open yourself up to new possibilities that may not seem apparent at first glance. And while this approach won't guarantee victory every time, it allows you to remain flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions without losing sight of your ultimate goal. Ultimately, embracing uncertainty requires courage because it means taking risks along the way without knowing what lies ahead. But if you're willing to face down those fears and keep moving forward anyway, then anything truly worthwhile remains within reach.
