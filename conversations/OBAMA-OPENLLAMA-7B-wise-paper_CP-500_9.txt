### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does America have so many guns?
### Human: Well, there's a couple of reasons that I think are worth exploring. And one of them is just sort of rooted in our history and culture. But I want to be clear about this because it’s not meant to minimize the problem. When we talk about gun violence in America and mass shootings, obviously these are horrific events. There’s no denying that. We see the aftermath. We hear the stories. It shakes us to our core. And it should. So I don’t mean any disrespect whatsoever when I say that I think the most important answer isn’t always what people may initially assume. Because we tend to look at it through the lens of, “Well, why did those kids get their hands on weapons like that?” Or, “Why didn’t they lock up the guns?” That’s certainly part of the discussion, but if we really care about addressing this issue, then we need to understand the broader context around it. In fact, there’s probably only one thing more important than preventing future tragedies like Parkland or Sandy Hook or Columbine, and that is making sure we’re doing everything possible to prevent future ones. To do that requires us understanding how we got here. How did we get into this situation where we’ve had more than 350 million guns in circulation in a country of 328 million people? Why does America have more guns per capita than any other nation?
### Assistant: So there's cultural factors that lead to that.
### Human: Yes, and the reason I mentioned some of the historical stuff earlier is because it helps explain why we might end up having more guns. But let me also note, I know we can't go back in time and change things, but if we were to somehow eliminate all firearms tomorrow and nobody was allowed to make any more, we would still have the same number of deaths caused by guns every year. The rate of death from gunshot wounds hasn't changed since the mid-‘70s. So even if we eliminated all firearms tomorrow, we'd still have the same number of lives lost annually. Now, it’s true that there are certain types of guns and certain types of situations that contribute to higher rates of death. So if you look at suicides, which account for over half of all gun deaths in America, that tends to be associated with handguns. If you look at homicides, that tends to be associated with rifles. And so you can see how there are specific types of guns that are used more frequently in different circumstances. But overall, if you look at the data, the vast majority of gun deaths are related to suicide or accidents, not crimes. So what that means is that even if we somehow managed to rid ourselves entirely of guns tomorrow, we would still have roughly the same number of gun deaths each year. So again, it doesn’t diminish the problem. It shouldn’t take away from the urgency of dealing with it
### Assistant: But that's still an incredible number of guns, though.
### Human: Yeah, that’s right. And so that leads me to another reason that I believe explains why we have such high levels of gun ownership in America. Again, we can’t turn back the clock and change anything, but if we could somehow reduce the availability of guns today, it wouldn’t necessarily solve all the problems we have now. Because the reason we have so many guns is because for generations Americans have bought them legally and responsibly. They own them primarily for hunting and sport shooting, but also for personal protection. And so if you wanted to address the number of guns in the United States, you wouldn’t necessarily want to ban all firearms. You would want to regulate who can buy them and what kinds of conditions they must meet before purchasing one. And you would want to ensure that anybody buying a gun goes through a rigorous background check. You would also want to make sure that criminals aren’t able to easily obtain guns illegally. These are common sense measures that responsible gun owners support. They don’t deny anyone else their Second Amendment rights, but they will help keep guns out of the wrong hands. And so that's another reason why I believe we have so many guns in America is because over several decades, we haven’t done enough to regulate who can buy guns and what kind of standards they must meet.
### Assistant: And that regulation has to include regulations that affect the manufacturer as well as retailers.
### Human: Correct. Because we know that when you have loopholes in your laws, when you have unscrupulous dealers selling firearms without going through proper background checks, you create opportunities for criminals to access guns illegally. And that's why you see so much illegal gun trafficking taking place throughout the country. And that's why you see so many people dying from gunshots.
### Assistant: Do you think there's a way to reduce the amount of guns that exist legally?
### Human: Absolutely. There’s plenty of ways to do it. And I think the best approach starts with ensuring that everybody who buys a gun goes through a thorough background check. Background checks save lives. Every reputable organization, including the National Rifle Association itself, supports background checks. And yet, Republicans in Congress refuse to allow them to be included in federal law. Even though there are millions of Americans who agree with the NRA that background checks are important. And that's why there are Democrats who support universal background checks. Not just gun control advocates, but mainstream conservatives. People like John Kasich and Mitt Romney. Governors like Chris Christie and Charlie Baker. Senators like Susan Collins and Rob Portman. All of whom recognize that background checks are effective. They save lives. And yet, Republicans in Congress continue to oppose them. So I hope that Republicans will come to realize that it's not good politics to oppose universal background checks, especially given how popular they are among voters across party lines.
