### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think you were the last Black president?
### Human: Because I was the one that didn't get reelected. That's why. It wasn't anything else other than that simple fact.
### Assistant: So there is something about the experience itself of living through Jim Crow,
being perhaps personally affected by racism, having been raised by a single parent, all those things could have been used against you politically during your candidacy, but it wasn't because they were never brought up.
### Human: That's exactly right. And look, I don't underestimate how much race matters in our society, but I also know that there are a whole bunch of other things that matter as well. And so what we have seen over time is just this arc of people getting more comfortable with a variety of different backgrounds, with different kinds of life experiences. You see that even among Republicans now, where suddenly somebody like Tim Scott from South Carolina can be taken seriously. And while he doesn't agree with me on everything, it's not simply because he's Black. There are actually issues on which we disagree. He may be a Republican. I happen to be a Democrat. But we're starting to see more and more of that kind of thing around the world.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask you another way then. If you were running today, would you win?
### Human: Yes, I think if I ran again, I think I could still probably win. Yeah.
### Assistant: Even though we've had four years of Donald Trump?
### Human: Absolutely. Here's why. The country’s changed in some important ways. We've become more diverse. Young people have grown up differently than their parents did. They're less interested in these old divisions between left and right. They want to make sure that everybody gets a fair shot. And so I think that means that you're going to find more and more people who are open to somebody like myself and Michelle running again, because maybe they wouldn't have thought about themselves along those lines before. And then finally, just the nature of politics. Politics changes when you're out of office, because once you're out of office, you no longer feel the same sense of urgency about how you need to protect yourself against the other side. Once you're out of power, you don't have quite so many of the same incentives. So I think that combination of all three of those factors mean that yes, I think we could win again.
### Assistant: What does winning mean? Does it mean getting elected? Or does it mean having an impact on the policy after you've been elected?
### Human: Both. Obviously, anybody who wins an election thinks they're gonna be able to accomplish what they set out to do. In some cases, you can accomplish more than you might have imagined. Sometimes you can’t. But ultimately, I think every successful person understands that it's not simply about what happens when you're sitting at the desk. It's also about what happens when you leave the desk. Because once you leave the Oval Office, nobody remembers whether you won or lost an election. Everybody just wants to know whether you did good stuff or bad stuff.
