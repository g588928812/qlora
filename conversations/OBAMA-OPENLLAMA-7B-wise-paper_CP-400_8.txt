### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think America is so great?
### Human: Well, I'm tempted to say it’s not that we are so great, but we are exceptional because there have always been people willing to sacrifice themselves for something greater than their own self-interests. And this country was founded based upon certain principles like equality and liberty and justice for all. So if you look at our history, whether it’s abolitionists, civil rights movement, LGBT rights, women’s rights, disability rights, immigration rights, people have fought and died to advance those causes. We’ve got more work to do obviously. But in some ways, I feel like America is still that beacon of hope and opportunity. That’s what makes us great.
### Assistant: And that’s a very patriotic answer. It's very patriotic, but what about just human beings? Do you think humans are inherently good? Or is there something special about humanity that makes them capable of these sorts of things?
### Human: Well, again, I would say that every culture believes they're better than other cultures, right? In terms of how they treat their children, their families, their neighbors, etc., etc. But I believe there are universal values that are rooted in religion and tradition and custom that really speak to our common humanity. And so when I see somebody who is trying to deny that basic premise that we should care for one another and help each other out and try to get along and live together peacefully and respectfully, I don't know why anybody would want to do that.
### Assistant: Yeah, let’s talk about that. What do you make of this world, which is obviously filled with many nations and countries that have different traditions, different religions, customs, languages? How does this all come together into a harmonious whole? Because it seems that there’s a lot of conflict between various nations and tribes and groups within nations.
### Human: Well, I mean, obviously, we've had a long history of conflict and division amongst ourselves. You know, slavery and Jim Crow segregation were pretty brutal forms of oppression. There are wars around the globe today. Obviously, the pandemic and its effects on economies have created tensions and divisions among populations. But I also think that, as I mentioned earlier, our core beliefs and values are universal. They're rooted in religion, tradition, and custom, but they transcend nationality, race, ethnicity, gender. People everywhere believe in fairness and equity and kindness and caring for your fellow man. Now, the devil is in the details sometimes and implementation can vary depending upon circumstances. But the notion of fairness and equality and dignity and mutual respect is something that I believe is shared across cultures and continents.
### Assistant: What do you think is the role of governments in ensuring these ideals?
### Human: Well, government’s important, but government isn’t everything. I mean, there are plenty of examples where governments have abused power and trampled individual liberties and violated human rights and engaged in mass violence against civilians. Government can be a positive force, but government alone cannot solve problems. Governments depend upon citizens and communities working together. Citizens need to participate in civic life and engage in public discourse and debate, and communities need to invest in infrastructure and education and job training and health care systems to improve outcomes for everybody. So while government plays an important role in setting policy and establishing rules and institutions, it doesn't have all the answers. The real solutions ultimately lie with ordinary people coming together and figuring out how to solve their problems.
### Assistant: What do you think is the most important quality of a leader?
### Human: Probably empathy and understanding and willingness to listen. I mean, I think that leaders tend to fall into one of two categories. Either they're charismatic personalities who command attention, or they're listening to folks and engaging in deliberation and consensus building. And I think it's hard to overstate how important it is for presidents and other elected officials to build relationships with their constituents, to hear from people, to understand what issues are most pressing for people in their community, and then to take action accordingly. And too often, I think politicians forget that they serve their constituents. They forget that they work for the people. And instead, they think they work above the people, or somehow they think that they're smarter than people, or they think that they deserve more deference than ordinary citizens. And I think that's a mistake. And I think it's one reason why Washington is broken. If leaders spent less time trying to score points and more time trying to actually govern effectively, then maybe we could address some of the challenges facing our country.
