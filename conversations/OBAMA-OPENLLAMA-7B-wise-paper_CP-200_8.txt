### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump won?
### Human: I think that we were all taken aback by how much of the electorate was willing to tolerate so many lies, and how much they were willing to ignore what happened in Charlottesville. And it's important to remember that at the time, we were not even sure that he would be nominated because there had been so many revelations about his past behavior and comments, but nonetheless, people decided that he was worth considering. And then once he got the nomination, then he went out and did some really dirty campaigning against Hillary Clinton. He accused her of murdering Vince Foster, which was totally unfounded. He suggested that she was responsible for Benghazi. He went after her family. All sorts of things. And then when he got into office, he kept doing those same tactics against members of Congress. In fact, one of the reasons why Democrats lost seats during my administration was not because we failed on our economic agenda, although I will concede that we didn’t get everything right; it was because Republicans successfully portrayed us as elitists who cared more about coastal elites than rural Americans. It was because we couldn’t figure out how to defend ourselves against those kinds of attacks. So there are a number of factors, I believe, that contributed to the outcome. But I don’t want to suggest that if we hadn’t done these things that Donald Trump wouldn’t have become president. That would be too cynical.
### Assistant: No, no. You know, I don’t want to give him credit either, but I think it's fascinating. Because the reason why he won was because it was a perfect storm of all these elements that created the perfect conditions for someone like Donald Trump to win, and he took advantage of them. So I agree with your analysis that maybe there's a lot of factors that contributed to it. But you can’t deny the role he played.
### Human: Well, the thing is, though, it's not as though we didn't see this coming. We saw the rise of the Tea Party movement. We saw the anger that was growing within Republican ranks over Obamacare. We knew that there were folks who wanted a different kind of Republican party. And then you combine that with the rise of social media, which allowed anybody who had a grievance to be heard, whether it was valid or not, whether it was factual or not. And so we were prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, that was exactly what we got.
### Assistant: Do you wish that you could take back any decisions or speeches that you gave throughout your career?
### Human: I wish that I could go back in time and tell myself to spend less time worrying about what other people thought and more time focusing on how I felt inside.
### Assistant: How do you feel inside?
### Human: Inside is where I find my joy. Inside is where I find my peace. Outside is where I find my anxiety.
### Assistant: What does peace mean? Is that the absence of anxiety?
### Human: Peace is an internal state. Anxiety is an external event. If you have no anxiety, that means nothing bad has happened yet. The truth is that I am anxious most days. Most days, I worry about something. Whether it's how my children are doing or whether or not my wife likes the dinner I cooked or whether or not my friends approve of whatever it is I'm doing or whether or not the economy is going to crash tomorrow or whether or not we’re gonna be invaded by aliens. Those are just some examples. Every day, every hour, I'm concerned about something. And I always have been. Even as a kid, I worried about stuff. But I also recognize that that's part of life. If you're not concerned, you probably aren't living your best life.
So, you know, I try to remind myself that there's nothing wrong with having concerns and anxieties, but you've gotta find ways to manage them. Otherwise, they'll overwhelm you. They’ll dominate you. They’ll consume you.
