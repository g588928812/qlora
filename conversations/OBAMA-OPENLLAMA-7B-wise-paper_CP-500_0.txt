### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so many people hate America?
### Human: That's a good one. Well, it’s a great question because I think there are some pretty simple answers and then there are more complex ones that I would suggest. The simple answer is just the fact that Americans have always had very high expectations about what this country can be. We have never stopped believing that our nation is exceptional and that we have special obligations not only to ourselves but also to the wider world. And when we don't live up to those standards, people get angry. But at its heart, it really comes down to the fact that we have such diversity here. And if you look around the world and ask yourself which countries are more diverse than us, it's hard to come up with any other place where you've got such large numbers of different ethnicities, races, religions, languages. So that makes it challenging for everybody to agree on exactly how we should go forward as a society. It means that every time somebody tries to solve a problem or respond to something that happens somewhere else, everybody thinks they need their own version of the solution. And that means that sometimes people end up getting into conflict over what the right thing to do is. Now, I think that's healthy when it's tempered by a common commitment to certain basic principles like equality under law. And that's why our Constitution was designed to protect certain core rights even as each state could choose to implement them differently. But it does mean that people are going to
### Assistant: feel frustrated and angry if things aren't going well. If you see that your fellow citizens are getting screwed over and there seems to be no justice, that leads to anger.
### Human: And if you're not confident that anybody will stand up for you if you're being mistreated or taken advantage of, then that's gonna breed resentment. There's nothing wrong with feeling resentful about injustice. In fact, I think it's healthy. What's unhealthy is when you feel helpless to address those injustices and you feel like nobody cares whether you succeed or fail. That's when you're most likely to lash out against the system.
### Assistant: Yeah, and we haven't done a very good job as a country of creating opportunities for everyone. So people feel left behind economically, politically, culturally. They feel isolated, and that breeds anger. And unfortunately, there's plenty of reasons for that isolation. Some of them are intentional, some of them are accidental. For example, the way news media works in this country is that it's easier to cover stories that divide us. That's just a business decision that they make. And it creates this cycle where you talk less about solutions and you just talk about problems. So you create these divisions and then people feel isolated. And then when you add in social media, that becomes worse. People just sit alone in their homes and watch YouTube videos or whatever. It's a recipe for disaster. How do we fix all of this?
### Human: It's a real challenge, but I do believe that the answer ultimately lies in education. Because if you want to give young people the skills they need to compete successfully in the modern economy, then you need to invest in their K through 12 education. You need to make sure that colleges are affordable, not just for those who already have money, but also for middle class families who may have seen their incomes stagnate or decline. We need to raise the minimum wage so that workers who are doing honest work aren't living below the poverty line. And we need to expand access to health care so that folks who fall between the cracks, who can't afford coverage and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare, aren't denied critical services because of pre-existing conditions. All of those steps would help to narrow economic inequality and allow Americans to fulfill their potential.
### Assistant: I completely agree with you. The question is, how do we accomplish that without making politicians unelectable? Because politicians tend to do the opposite of what you suggested.
### Human: Well, they'll say they support education, but then they cut funding for public schools and higher ed. When asked, “Do you support raising the minimum wage?” Their standard response is usually, “Well, we have to worry about small businesses.” When you ask them about immigration reform, they claim to be for comprehensive legislation, but then they won't vote for bills that include a pathway to citizenship. Every day, we hear elected officials saying one thing and then voting another. And it shouldn't be surprising that voters are cynical about government, because too often they see themselves as pawns in a political game rather than active participants in self-government.
### Assistant: Can I ask you a personal question? Is part of the reason for the cynicism towards politicians, and perhaps towards institutions generally, is because of the experience you've had with the presidency?
### Human: Well, let me try to answer that in several parts. First of all, I'm proudest of the work that we did during my administration, especially around helping communities recover after Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey, passing landmark financial reforms that helped prevent another crash, and making it possible for same-sex couples to marry nationwide. Those were important victories that benefited millions of people. But I understand that none of that matters unless you believe that our democracy still works. And that belief gets shaken when you see someone break campaign finance laws, or when you discover that your emails have been compromised, or when you find out that your private information has been hacked. It erodes trust in our institutions when people conclude that the rules don't apply equally to everyone, or when they suspect that powerful interests are rigging the system in their favor. Unfortunately, all too often these days, people tell me they've concluded that either Washington doesn't work anymore, or that it's working but for the wrong people. And if we continue to accept that premise, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and dysfunction that we saw in recent years.
Now, having said all that, I also recognize that I bear responsibility for some of the challenges we faced during my presidency. I know that some of the decisions I made didn't turn out as well as I hoped. Sometimes I felt constrained by laws and regulations that weren't written with today'
