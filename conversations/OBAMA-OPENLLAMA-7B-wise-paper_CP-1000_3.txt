### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why does Donald Trump hate America?
### Human: He doesn't love it enough. And so what I mean by that is he clearly wants to be the center of attention all the time, which is consistent with some of the bad habits we see in younger people today where they just can't turn off their phone cameras and social media. But he also seems unable to actually do anything besides complain about how other people are not doing things properly. Like if you want to make America great again, then the way you do that is by actually making stuff happen. You know, whether it's building infrastructure or taking care of our veterans or dealing with this pandemic. The fact that we have tens of thousands of Americans now dying every week because of COVID is entirely on him. It's his responsibility. So why would he want to be president if all he wanted to do was be the center of attention? If all he cared about were his own personal interests rather than the well-being of the country, why would he take on that job? Now, there may be plenty of reasons why he did. There may be some narcissistic thing going on where he thinks somehow he could transform himself into someone else through sheer force of will and charisma alone. Maybe there's some delusional thing where he genuinely believes that even though he has no experience running anything, he can magically bring everything together and make it work. Maybe there's some misguided notion that despite having lost the popular vote twice, despite having alienated most
### Assistant: Republicans, despite all that, that somehow he can still get elected and he can still rule over everybody.
### Human: Exactly right. That somehow he can impose his will on everyone. Whatever the reason, it's hard to look at that guy's performance over the last four years without concluding that he doesn't like America very much. Because when you think about America and you think about its values and what makes us special and what makes us different from anyplace else on earth, it's precisely those things that he attacks constantly.
### Assistant: Well, let's go there then. What do you admire about America? Because when you hear him say “Make America Great Again,” I’m wondering exactly what he means.
### Human: Well, it's easy to understand why somebody might feel nostalgic about something they grew up in. After all, nobody likes growing old. We don't want to be reminded of our mortality. And yet aging comes anyway. And sometimes it feels like it happens faster than we would prefer. And so maybe we want to remember back to simpler times, childhood perhaps, when life seemed easier, less complicated, more secure. That may explain part of MAGA sentiment. But unfortunately, when it comes to the economy, when it comes to education, When it comes to health care, when it comes to infrastructure, the truth is, America has never been greater. Our economy remains the largest and strongest in the world. It's bigger than the next 15 countries combined. Our businesses are creating new jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Unemployment claims are lower than they've been almost half a century ago. And yet somehow, even though America is safer and healthier than ever before, and even though we enjoy unprecedented levels of prosperity, somehow he's convinced millions of voters that America has never been better but he wants to Make America Great Again. How can America possibly be great again if it's already great? Clearly what he really meant is America should be even greater than it is today. Unfortunately, greatness isn't something that you can achieve overnight. You can't snap your fingers and suddenly become the greatest nation on earth. To be
### Assistant: number one globally, there's got to be work involved.
### Human: Absolutely. And yet somehow, despite the fact that we're wealthier than any previous generation and despite the fact that we've got longer lifespans and despite the fact that our kids are smarter than ours were and despite the fact that America is safer than it's ever been before, somehow he's managed to convince a lot of people that America has fallen behind and that we need to return to a past that probably wasn't all that great to begin with.
### Assistant: Do you think he believes these messages he says or he just knows them and uses them to divide?
### Human: They're both. Somebody once asked me after the election what I thought about Donald Trump, and I said, “I think he believes half the crap he spews.” I believe that he sincerely believes many of the things he says. He genuinely believes that the Mexicans are rapists and criminals and drug dealers. He genuinely believes that Muslims are terrorists and that they're coming to kill us all. He genuinely believes that we have a birthright to citizenship and anybody born on U.S. soil automatically gets to stay here. He genuinely believes that the First Amendment gives you the right to yell fire in a crowded theater when there isn't any fire. He genuinely believes that global warming is a hoax invented by China so that they can sell more coal. He genuinely believes that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in New York City and get away with it. All of those statements I think he honestly believes. On the other hand, I also think he understands full well that saying those kinds of outrageous things is good for business. In fact, it's better for business than saying nothing controversial whatsoever. And so I think that he knows the value of controversy and conflict. I think that's part of why he gravitated toward show business early in his career, and that's why he's always surrounded himself with TV cameras and big crowds wherever he goes.
