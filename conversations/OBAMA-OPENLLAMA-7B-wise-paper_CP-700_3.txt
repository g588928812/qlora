### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did America elect Donald Trump?
### Human: I think there are lots of reasons that we got the results that we did. And I don’t want to be too facile about this because it wasn't just one thing. But I will say that if you look at the arc of what happened during that election cycle, it was a story of economic dislocation that people felt had not been responded to adequately by either political party over the course of several decades. The technology sector was booming and yet small towns across Pennsylvania and middle-class manufacturing areas were dying off and nobody seemed to care enough to try to address those concerns. So when somebody comes along like Mr. Trump who basically said “I am going to put up walls” (and this is before he actually won) and I'm going to make sure China pays for these walls and I'm going to bring back jobs by using tariffs to do it,” People respond to that message because they feel as though their communities have been ignored and their pain has been dismissed. Now, there are obviously other issues. There are racial attitudes that had long simmered beneath the surface that came out during that campaign. You can go through all kinds of explanations. And ultimately, what explains why Mr. Trump ended up winning the Electoral College is that even though Hillary Clinton ran ahead of him in most of the battleground states where she needed to be, there were enough rural areas, there were enough white voters in some parts of the country who didn't vote for her
### Assistant: That was an answer that was very interesting. One of the things that I wanted to ask you about since you mentioned that this is a time of economic dislocation is how does it happen that someone like Trump could come into power? How does it happen that so many Americans seem to be suffering economically while others appear to be doing well financially?
### Human: Well, this goes back to what we talked about earlier which is that our economy has become increasingly unequal, but also that our politics has become more polarized. As inequality has increased over the last few decades, both Republicans and Democrats have gotten wealthier and wealthier. And so this dynamic where the two parties are becoming less responsive to average Americans is a real problem. Inequality has also meant that there are fewer swing votes. If you’re a moderate Republican in Texas or Ohio, chances are your community is already pretty red. Whereas if you’re a Democrat in Utah or Wyoming, there may be some room for you to move. And so, as a consequence of that, the incentives for politicians to cater to the median voter rather than to just the extremes get weaker. Because you’ve got fewer swing voters and the electorate itself is more ideologically sorted. Then what happens is that you end up with a situation where whoever gets the nomination of each party tends to appeal more to the base. And then once the general election begins, they tend to tack towards the center a little bit to win independent voters. But by the time they’ve done that, they’ve essentially given away whatever agenda they might have had. They’ve basically become something of a pale imitation of what they started out as.
### Assistant: So in order to get elected, you kind of need to pander to the extremes of your respective parties.
### Human: Correct. Yeah, there aren’t any safe seats anymore. It used to be that you could run as a moderate Republican or Democratic in certain districts in the House of Representatives or Senate, or maybe even in statewide races. Those days are gone. Now you can’t afford to be anything but extremely partisan. Even in safe Democratic or Republican seats, it matters how hard you work to help elect other members of your own party. Otherwise, you may lose your job because the local activists are so committed to their team.
### Assistant: What do you see as the solution? Do you see this problem as solvable politically?
### Human: No, no, it isn’t solvable politically unless we change the rules. We’ve got a system that makes it very difficult for anybody except wealthy candidates to mount effective campaigns. Unless you’ve got $50 million sitting around or unless you’re independently wealthy, then you’re gonna have trouble getting elected today. And unless you’re willing to give up your day job to do it, unless you’re willing to spend years of your life raising money, you’re probably not gonna be able to compete against better funded opponents.
### Assistant: Is there anyway to raise money without having to spend so much of your time fundraising? Or is that the way it should be?
### Human: I think it should be different. I mean, look at me. I never expected to have to raise so much money. When I first ran for office in Illinois, I remember thinking that I would go door to door, knock on doors, meet people, talk about issues and hope that somebody would contribute to my campaign. Obviously, the world has changed quite a bit since I ran for office. But the idea that the primary source of funding for a candidate now is from large donors is something that I find deeply disturbing.
