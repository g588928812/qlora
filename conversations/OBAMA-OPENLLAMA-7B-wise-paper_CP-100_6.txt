### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why is democracy so fragile? Is it fragile because it's democratic? Or is it fragile because there are people in our society who do not believe in it? And what role does social media play in all this?

President Obama: Well, I think democracy is always fragile. It's not easy. But I also think that the kind of cynicism and suspicion towards government that we see today has roots in both parties. I mean, I was elected president at a time when many Americans were feeling frustrated and disaffected. And part of that frustration came from a growing inequality between rich and poor. And some folks in my party thought that if they could just get more tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, then everybody would be better off. The problem is that didn’t solve anybody’s problems. Some folks in my own party thought if they could just repeal Obamacare, then everybody will be healthier. That didn’t happen either. And so part of the reason why people felt like government wasn’t working was because we hadn’t delivered. We weren’t delivering for them.
### Human: So the Democrats weren’t doing their job.
### Assistant: No, no, no, no. Republicans weren’t doing theirs either. And so there was a lot of skepticism about whether government actually worked. At the same time, though, the country had gone through one of its greatest economic crises since the Great Depression, and we did pass an enormous stimulus package. And there was a real sense that Washington had gotten things done. But that doesn’t last forever. Even after we passed the Recovery Act, which saved millions of jobs and prevented us from going into a depression, unemployment remained high. There was still this sense that, “Well, nothing seems to work.” And I think that helped fuel a lot of this cynical attitude towards government.
So we have seen over recent years, particularly with the rise of Donald Trump, but even before him, a decline in faith in democracy itself. Not just political institutions, but trust in elections, trust in public servants, and ultimately trust in ourselves as citizens. And I think one of the reasons why we’re seeing that erosion of confidence is because we haven’t delivered on those basic promises that politicians make during campaigns. They say, “I’m going to cut taxes,” or “I’m going to lower your premiums,” or “I’m going to create jobs,” or “I’m going to restore the middle class.” And sometimes they do deliver. Sometimes they don’t. And if they don’t, then people lose faith in themselves as voters,
### Human: Because they think, “Oh, politicians lie.”
### Assistant: Yes. Now, look, if I may digress for a minute, this has been happening in Europe as well. In Britain, you had Brexit, right? Which ended up creating a whole bunch of chaos and confusion. In France, Macron won office promising to reduce income inequality, and then suddenly, he raised the wealth tax for millionaires. So you’ve got these populist movements rising around the world where politicians are saying things that are untrue, that aren’t true. You know, I remember campaigning against Mitt Romney back in 2012. He kept telling folks that I had spent $3 trillion on Obamacare when I’d only spent half a trillion dollars. He lied. (Laughter) And I guess if you’re lying enough times and consistently, then people stop believing you. So, you know, this erosion of faith in the system is not unique to America. But what makes it uniquely American is that we are a self-governing republic founded on principles of liberty and equality and opportunity. That means that each individual citizen gets to decide how much power they want to invest in government. And the way you invest in government is through voting. So we have built into our Constitution, our founding documents, this idea that every single person should have a voice in determining who governs them. And that’s what makes America special. And yet, despite that commitment, despite the fact that we are constantly reminding ourselves of that commitment,
### Human: But it’s also worth remembering that most countries have a similar claim, like, “We the People…” Like, the notion that the power belongs to the people. That’s a common thing across the globe.
President Obama: It is. It’s something that I talk about in my memoir, A Promised Land. I go back to the origins of America. When Thomas Jefferson wrote those words, the Declaration of Independence, the whole point of declaring independence was so that the colonists could rule themselves rather than be ruled by England. But the colonists recognized that it wouldn’t work unless everybody had a vote and everybody participated in the decisionmaking process. So, yes, it is a fundamental premise upon which America was established. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t break down. I mean, you can argue that in many European democracies—you look at Germany, you look at Italy, you look at France—that the electorate is very polarized. And so you end up having politicians who are catering to small minority groups rather than trying to build coalitions and try to appeal to broader swaths of the population. And then you wind up with leaders who may have broad support within their constituencies, but they’re not able to bring together larger blocs of voters who feel excluded. And that is a recipe for dysfunction.
### Assistant: I want to ask about Donald Trump specifically. How did someone like Donald Trump come to occupy the White House? Did he represent the worst aspects of America or something else? What do you think happened?
### Human: Do you see parallels between Trump and Hitler?
Yes, I think there are similarities.
Yes, I think there are similarities, yes.
### Assistant: Okay, let me ask you this. Does Trump reflect the worst parts of human nature, or is he a symptom of a deeper sickness in American society?
### Human: I think he reflects the worst parts of human nature.
