### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so few great leaders rise to power today? And what does it take to be one?
### Human: Well, there are a lot of factors at work here that have nothing to do with leadership itself. I think one thing we’ve seen over the last several decades, especially since World War II, is a steady erosion of confidence about whether democracy can deliver the goods. So while people might agree that they want strong institutions, they may not feel like those institutions actually deliver for them. They don’t see themselves represented in their government, they don’t trust their elected officials, they’re worried about corruption, they don’t believe politicians tell the truth when they speak to voters directly through the media. All these things feed into this broader feeling of cynicism. Now, if you combine that with social media and a certain degree of polarization, then suddenly you end up with candidates who are more focused on how they can get attention than how they can solve problems. It becomes very easy to play to your base, but not necessarily appeal to persuadable independent voters who don’t feel strongly attached to any particular party.
### Assistant: What’s the way out of this cycle?
### Human: There’s no magic wand. But part of it is going back to basics. One thing that was true during my time in office was that even though people were frustrated with gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, Americans still believed in public service and wanted good men and women to serve in our national government. We saw that most clearly when we had record turnouts for midterms after my election because people felt invested in the outcome. I think we also saw it when we went through a historic shift in demographics, when Barack Obama was president, and we got a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress for the first time in many years. When we did that, it wasn’t because Democrats ran better campaigns; it was because Republican candidates couldn’t win outside of the South, where demographic trends weren’t favorable to Republicans. The same thing happened in Virginia and New Jersey when Terry McAuliffe and Phil Murphy won governor races because Republicans couldn’t compete in urban areas. That’s why it’s important for us to make sure we’re investing in statehouses around the country and building up grassroots organizations that can help us compete everywhere. Because otherwise, all the money that goes into TV ads and consultants will go disproportionately to the places where there’s already a built-in advantage for one side or another.
### Assistant: In terms of statehouse, I would love to talk to you about education policy. How do you transform a system where kids aren’t getting a quality education? Where teachers are underpaid and disrespected?
### Human: Well, I think that education is the single best investment we could make as a nation. If we’re serious about preparing workers for the jobs of tomorrow and helping every child fulfill their potential, we’ve got to make investments in education, starting early. As far as I know, there isn’t a major industry anywhere in America that doesn’t depend on workers having some level of postsecondary training or education beyond high school. Whether it’s advanced manufacturing or health care or information technology, you name it. Everybody knows that a four-year college degree is no guarantee of success anymore. For example, I met with a woman recently whose husband had just gotten laid off. He was making $85,000 a year, which is well above average, but she said, “I worry that my daughter won’t be able to afford her tuition.” And so the reality is we need to expand opportunities for students to earn college credit while they’re still in high school, especially if they haven’t mastered core subjects such as math and science. We should offer financial aid to middle class families that aren’t eligible for Pell grants. We should encourage states to raise their minimum wages so that young people aren’t working full time and still living at home. We need to increase funding for vocational programs and apprenticeships so that kids who don’t want to pursue four-year degrees have a real shot at earning family sustaining salaries without taking on
### Assistant: Student debt.
### Human: Student debt. And that means we’ve got to stop demonizing trade schools and community colleges. These are not second-tier options. A lot of folks I know who started out in community college eventually transferred to a four-year institution and wound up doing quite well. But we’ve got to recognize that sometimes life requires you to acquire skills on the job instead of sitting in a classroom. We need to give parents and educators more flexibility so they can tailor learning experiences to each kid’s unique needs rather than trying to shoehorn everyone into cookie cutter curricula that’s designed for someone else’s circumstances. And finally, I think we ought to look abroad to countries like Germany and Japan, which invest heavily in vocational training. We tend to look down on blue collar work and assume that only people who aren’t smart enough for college wind up doing manual labor. But the truth is, a lot of technical careers require higher levels of skill and creativity than what you find in academia. That’s why we’d be foolish to ignore the enormous opportunity that exists right now to retool our economy for the digital age. Instead of just throwing up our hands and saying, “Oh, we can’t compete,” let’s make a concerted effort to build the infrastructure necessary to support innovation and growth in fields ranging from renewable energy to artificial intelligence.
### Assistant: Let me ask you about immigration policy. You were known as the deporter in chief. You deported millions of immigrants, legal and illegal. But recently you said that you believe that Dreamers should be allowed to stay in this country. And you’re also pushing Congress to pass a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. Can you explain why Dreamers deserve that chance to stay and why Congress should act now to provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers?
### Human: Sure. First of all, I think it’s worth reminding ourselves that there are roughly 6 million undocumented individuals who are contributing to the fabric of our society. Many of whom came here when they were children, grew up in the U.S., didn’t break the law intentionally, and have become productive members of their communities. Their contributions include everything from caring for aging relatives to serving in our armed forces to running small businesses that employ Americans. They’re doctors and engineers and scientists and farmers and teachers and artists. And these are people who deserve to be treated with decency and dignity. But I also think it’s important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants in this country are either brought here against their own will as minors or come here legally on temporary visas that expire and simply decide not to leave. So I think it’s fair to say that most unauthorized immigrants broke our laws, but they also took a calculated risk when they crossed the border illegally.
They knew it was risky to enter the country without permission, and yet they chose to do it anyway because they believed it was worth it for them and their loved ones. So I think it’s also fair to acknowledge that many of these individuals have played by the rules, paid taxes, and contributed positively to their communities. And that makes it difficult to argue that deporting them serves the national interest. On the other hand, if someone enters the country illegally, repeatedly violates its terms of entry
