### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do so many people hate him?
### Human: (Laughs) I don't think they hate me personally. They may disagree with me politically. They might not like what I did when I was president. But I don't actually think that there is a reservoir of personal animosity towards me. Now, there are some folks out there whose primary political activity is to try to delegitimize everything I stand for and have done. And I think if you look at their rhetoric, it is pretty clear that their objective is to make sure that I am not regarded as someone who can legitimately claim any sort of moral authority. So they will say things about me which would be deeply offensive to anyone else. The notion that somehow I’m a Muslim, that somehow I wasn’t born in this country, these are all things that I consider beneath contempt.
### Assistant: Well, let’s talk about those three topics specifically. You were a practicing Christian for most of your life, but then became a Muslim for eight years during your time in office. Why?
### Human: It’s actually not something I ever talked about publicly while I was in office because I didn’t want any more attention on that than necessary. But having now left government and also having spent some time since then reflecting on how much I care about the world, I do feel comfortable talking about this now. When I was younger, when I was in college, I started to experiment with different religions. In part because I was trying to figure out who I was, what I believed. In part because religion had played such an important role in my family background growing up. Both my mother and father come from a very religious background. My dad from a Christian Scientist household. My mom was brought up Catholic. And I think initially I just wanted to know where she came from, her side of the family. What was her heritage? And she encouraged us to go and visit them in Ireland when we were kids. She took us to see her family in Galway. She spoke Gaelic. She still does speak Gaelic. We could barely understand her. But that whole experience of seeing that extended family, hearing stories about their lives, really piqued our interest in learning more about our roots. So I went off to Harvard and I enrolled in a course called “The Study of Religion.” I think partly it was just intellectual curiosity; partly it was to find answers to questions I couldn’t answer. And I remember there were several points along the way where I felt like I
### Assistant: Somebody should write a book about this.
### Human: There’s probably enough material there somewhere. Anyway, yeah, it was a long process and it continues to evolve even today. But during that period, I started to explore other faith traditions. And after graduating from law school, before starting work at the University of Chicago, I moved to New York City. At that point, I had already begun a relationship with Michelle Robinson, who later became my wife. And so we both ended up moving to Manhattan, living together. I got a job working at a corporate firm downtown. She was clerking on Wall Street. And we lived around the corner from each other. And one of the places where we often found ourselves going to meet friends was a local mosque. And that’s where I first began to hear the call to prayer echoing across the city streets. And I thought it was beautiful. I liked the sound of it. And I asked some of our mutual friends who were Muslims whether it would be OK if I went over and said hello once in a while. Nobody seemed to mind. And so I eventually decided to take a class at the local community center where the imam invited me to come over and join the class. And so I attended services there every Friday for a few months. And it gave me a sense of the rituals associated with Islam and some basic understanding of its theological tenets. Eventually I converted. I went back home to Chicago, told my parents, explained why I had chosen to convert, and they were
### Assistant: How did their response differ compared to yours grandparents?
### Human: Well, they were upset at first, mainly because they weren’t sure how Michelle was taking it. I mean, she herself was raised Roman Catholic. Her own family was a little bit more traditional than mine. I grew up in Hawaii. So it wasn’t a big deal for me. For her, coming from a very strict Catholic family in South Carolina, where her grandfather and great-grandfather had been pastors, I think there was concern that she might be negatively affected by my decision. So it was a difficult conversation. They didn’t accept it right away. But ultimately, as usual with my parents, they rolled with it. They were proud of me. They understood that it was something that meant a lot to me. And they knew I wouldn’t have done it unless it meant something to me.
### Assistant: Do you still practice today?
### Human: No, I haven’t practiced regularly since leaving the White House. There are various reasons for that. One, frankly, is that after nearly twenty years in public service, I was looking forward to getting back into private life. Michelle and I had young daughters who needed stability. And so rather than move to another place and set up new surroundings, we decided to stay put near our church and our mosque and our synagogue. So I was able to continue attending services there. Also, my day job involved lots of international travel, sometimes around the clock. And so I rarely had the opportunity to get to the mosque except maybe once or twice a year. And finally, I think there was just a certain amount of disillusionment with organized religion. Not because of anything that happened during my time in office. That certainly never bothered me. I always tried to live up to the high ethical standards that I was taught growing up and that I believe that people of all faiths share. But I think that as somebody who spent a fair amount of time interacting with people from all walks of life, including those who are less fortunate than myself, it was hard not to notice the hypocrisy that sometimes exists within some segments of the religious community. And so although I remained committed to my faith, I stopped going to services and instead focused on reading and studying on my own.
