### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think it's important that young people vote?
### Human: I think there are many reasons why voting is important. I mean, first off, we want a government that represents us, right? And so one way that happens is through elections. We have a representative democracy. That means representatives are elected by the people to represent their interests. So if you don't participate in those elections, then you're not going to get your voice heard about what issues matter most to you and how they should be addressed. Secondly, you may like some candidates more than others. You may even love some candidates. But even if you support somebody, even if you know they would be great president or governor or mayor or whatever office you care about, they still need to win. They still need votes in order to get into office. So voting is just part of our system. It's how we make sure that everyone gets their say in our democracy. Thirdly, voting gives us a sense of ownership over our democracy. When you go vote, you’re saying “I am a citizen.” You're participating. And when we all participate, we help to create this sense of shared values and common purpose, which makes our country stronger.
### Assistant: Can you talk about the importance of voting for minorities and underrepresented communities and groups?
### Human: Well, there are certainly some folks out there who think that only certain kinds of people should vote. Those people tend to be white males. And sometimes they will say that because women shouldn't vote or Black Americans shouldn't vote or Latinos shouldn't vote. Or they might say, well, poor people can't vote. Or young people can't vote. Or immigrants shouldn't vote. None of these things are true, of course. Anybody who is eligible to vote has every right to vote. And any group that believes that other groups aren't entitled to vote, they should ask themselves whether they would want someone else to deny them access to something that was vital to their own freedom and prosperity.
### Assistant: There's also the notion of representation. Do you think the current state of our democracy is representative enough for the full spectrum of different races, ethnicities, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, gender identities, sexual orientations, political ideologies?
### Human: Absolutely. In fact, it could be better. As I said earlier, our system of government is based upon the idea of equal citizenship. We believe that everybody deserves a say in decisions that affect their lives, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or anything else. And so we expect our government to reflect this commitment to equality. Now, of course, our democracy has never lived up to its ideals on every issue at all times, but overall, the progress we've made since the civil rights era, where we ended Jim Crow segregation and began guaranteeing voting rights to formerly disenfranchised groups, has been remarkable. And today, the majority of Americans belong to groups that were once discriminated against. Women now comprise half of Congress. Blacks and Hispanics are represented far beyond their share of the population. LGBT Americans enjoy newfound legal protections. Asian Americans are thriving economically and politically. And religious minorities, while still facing discrimination here and abroad, have much greater visibility and influence in U.S. society than ever before. All in all, we can feel pretty good about the progress America has made toward realizing the promise of our founding principles.
### Assistant: What is the role of technology in elections? Specifically, what is the role of social media platforms in elections? How do you think about that?
### Human: Technology is changing the way people communicate with each other, including politicians and voters. Social media plays a major role in modern campaigns. For example, Twitter and Facebook helped amplify the reach of my campaign message back in 2008. Today, Instagram and TikTok are popular among younger voters. But these innovations bring both benefits and challenges. On the plus side, social media allows politicians to connect directly with their supporters without relying on traditional intermediaries like newspapers, television stations, and radio hosts. This direct engagement offers voters a chance to hear the candidate’s views firsthand rather than relying on third party interpretations of their positions. On the downside, social media also presents risks. Misinformation and disinformation spread rapidly online, making it easier to deceive or mislead voters. And foreign actors exploit these vulnerabilities to try to sway public opinion. To address these challenges, I proposed several reforms during my administration, such as requiring internet companies to disclose who paid for political advertisements and strengthening penalties for spreading false information online. These steps helped prevent foreign interference in past elections, but we must continue to work together to safeguard our democracy from future threats.
### Assistant: Are there ways that we can strengthen democracy and improve civic education and participation?
### Human: Yes! The key is ensuring that every voter has accurate information about the candidates and ballot measures on election day. One simple step we can take is providing citizens with easy-to-use tools to check their registration status, find polling places, and request absentee ballots. Another helpful initiative is the National Voter Registration Day movement, which encourages individuals to register to vote ahead of Election Day. Finally, local governments can partner with schools to teach students about our democratic process and how they can participate in it. By working together, we can ensure that all eligible Americans have a meaningful opportunity to cast their ballots and have their voices heard.
