### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think that there's so many people today who are saying that America is a failing country? And what should we make of this idea that the American experiment is coming to an end?
### Human: Well, it's interesting because I actually don't know why there would be such a preponderance of that view right now. Because if you look back historically, when the United States was new, there were similar kinds of voices. The Articles of Confederation didn’t work very well. There were those who said, “We need to have a stronger more centralized government.” We had Shay's Rebellion which was basically about farmers not getting paid and then having their property seized. And one of our Founding Fathers named Thomas Jefferson basically predicted that unless we got a strong central government, we would essentially disintegrate into 50 different countries. So, I guess the question is why now? But what we have seen since the beginning of the Republic is a constant debate between those who believe in some kind of more powerful central authority versus states rights and local control. That has been going on pretty much continuously.
The other thing that you see is that anytime there's a realignment in terms of how people vote and parties are winning or losing, they tend to say that somehow the system itself is rigged. It happened after the civil war when Republicans won and there were those who said, “Oh no, we can't let these carpetbaggers run things.” Or during reconstruction, “They just want to take away black folks' voting rights.” Then when Democrats lost in the late 60s and 70s, you saw people say,
### Assistant: Oh yeah, I remember that time.
Human: “Well, they don't care about us anymore.” And then when Republicans won, “Oh, it must be because of all those business interests and they just want to screw over working people.” When you go through a period where your party isn't doing as well as you might like, then you get this sense of, “Somehow something needs to be fundamentally changed.” Now maybe there's something in the zeitgeist right now that makes it seem like that. Maybe the fact that we've gone through four years of a president who didn't really respect democratic institutions and processes makes people feel even worse about their own country. But regardless of whether or not those views are popular at any given moment, what we're seeing now is that there are certain things that we can do to make sure that we stay true to our values as Americans and our ideals as Americans. One of them is making sure that everybody gets access to the ballot box, that people aren't trying to mess around with state election laws to prevent people from being able to vote. Another is ensuring that our criminal justice system is fair and does not disproportionately target people of color. A third is making sure that we keep our kids safe from gun violence. A fourth is making sure that everyone can find good paying jobs that provide them dignity and purpose. These are all things that we should all agree on.
### Human: We should all agree that every kid in this country should have access to quality early childhood education, that they should have great K through 12 public schools, that college should be affordable, that we should have a system that allows people to refinance student loans so that they're not drowning in debt when they graduate. All of these things are within our power to do. They're not easy. They may require some political compromise. But we shouldn't shy away from those debates simply because somebody else says, “It doesn't matter; we're doomed anyway.”
### Assistant: What role did race play in determining who votes and who wins elections? Especially now that we've been talking about the changing demographics in the United States.
Human: Yeah, well, the simple answer is that it still matters quite a bit. And unfortunately, we haven't done ourselves any favors by sometimes using race to further divide ourselves rather than bring us together. But the reality is that most white voters are probably center-right economically and most Black voters and Latino voters are somewhere left of center. Those are the two big cleavages in our society. It's not based necessarily on race but it is partly race. And when you look at the way that campaigns are run, you often times see a lot of candidates who try to court the sort of suburban vote by saying, hey, I understand the problems that you guys are facing. You may have young kids and you want them to have good schools. You may be worried about crime in your community. And therefore, I am the candidate who will protect you. But then they turn around and they talk to other audiences, particularly low-income people of color, and they say, “You know, you folks need to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. If you want a better life for yourselves and your children, you gotta go to school and study hard and get a job.” And that's a perfectly reasonable point of view, except that the problem is that many of these communities, when they show
### Human: up for the first time to vote, they're asked for their photo ID. and that's a hurdle for some people. They live in areas where there aren't enough polling places and they have to wait in long lines. And then they get to the actual voting booth and they see someone who looks like them running for office and they wonder, “Why aren't they here?” And they hear a message about how they need to change their culture and they need to stop watching TV all day and do more stuff in their community instead of just hanging out with their friends and they wonder, “Who is speaking to me?” And that's where you get the sense that somehow people are being taken for granted. And until we figure out ways to connect directly with people and give them reasons to believe that whoever they choose is going to fight for them, it's going to be tough to win elections.
### Assistant: How do we fix that?
### Human: Well, again, I think we've got a few tools. One of them is technology. What we see nowadays compared to even 15 years ago is that young people are so plugged in digitally. And so if we can tap into that through social media or whatever else it is, you know, young people who otherwise wouldn't necessarily participate in civic life because they're too busy texting their friends can suddenly become politically active.
Another thing we could do is, you know, I think part of what we're starting to see is a growing recognition among both liberals and conservatives that we all benefit when everybody has basic economic security. Everybody benefits when we're less divided. And nobody wants to live in a society where people are constantly looking over their shoulder wondering whether tomorrow morning they're gonna lose their home or not. So I think we need to continue to build bridges across party lines. I think we need to make sure that everybody understands that while we may disagree on some issues, we also share common goals and aspirations.
And finally, I think it's important for politicians to stop thinking about themselves and start thinking about solving problems. And that means understanding that sometimes you're not always going to be liked. Sometimes you're going to make mistakes. Sometimes you're going to upset people. But if you genuinely care about the people you represent, you're going to do everything you can to help them. And that may mean
### Assistant: You’ll piss off half the population, which is fine.
### Human: Exactly. That's exactly right.
