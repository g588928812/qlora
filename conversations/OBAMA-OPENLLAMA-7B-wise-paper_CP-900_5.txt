### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did it take so long for a black man to be elected president?
### Human: Well, I mean, if we're just looking at raw statistics, there were more than enough Americans of all different backgrounds and ethnicities to have chosen somebody other than a white guy. If we’re looking strictly statistically at America, it would have happened eventually. It took longer because of this particular country’s history when it comes to race relations. And that had everything to do with both how people think about themselves and each other, but also their political traditions and the political parties they belong to and how they organized. There are some basic facts that you don't need a lot of sophisticated analysis to know. One was that many whites during Reconstruction after the Civil War felt like they hadn’d really paid their price for slavery, even though they certainly didn't own slaves. They still felt guilty and they wanted to move on. Secondly, you had the rise of Jim Crow laws across the South where you started having poll taxes, literacy tests, separate facilities for blacks and whites. Then you have a Supreme Court decision called Plessy v Ferguson that basically said, well, if these folks are separated but equal, then that's okay. Separate but equal is not inherently unconstitutional. So what ends up happening is segregation becomes entrenched in our society. The North doesn't necessarily experience Jim Crow, but it experiences de facto segregation. Black folks aren't allowed into certain neighborhoods, sometimes by law and sometimes just through custom and practice. So that means if
### Assistant: You can't vote, right?
### Human: No, no, you can vote, but you might not be able to get a job. You might not be able to rent a house. You might not be able to go to school, all kinds of things. So that created a situation where by the mid 20th century, African Americans living in the south were disenfranchised, often literally physically prevented from voting. But in the north too, de facto segregation meant that the average black person lived in communities where there wasn't much hope economically. The schools weren't good, the jobs weren't great. That meant there was less upward mobility generally for African Americans. Now, why does any of that matter? Because when you grow up in a ghetto or a neighborhood that isn't very hopeful, and your family circumstances aren’t very hopeful, and you feel like nobody cares about you, and you don't see anybody who looks like you anywhere around except maybe on TV doing something, which may or may not reflect reality accurately, then it creates a mindset among young people growing up. “Why should I try hard? What's the point?” When you combine that with parents who may not be the greatest role models, kids end up getting married early, having children out of wedlock, ending up trapped in low wage jobs, not finishing high school, not going to college. All those things together create a vicious cycle that makes it harder and harder for people to break out of
### Assistant: Is this before and after Obama? Are we talking about the 60s, 50s, 80s?
### Human: It goes back further than that, but let's talk about it since you mentioned the 60s. In the 60s, there was a real sense of progress. We elect a black president. He gets assassinated. You get another one elected, and he gets assassinated. By the time I came along, we had two presidents, and both of them had died violently while they were in office. So that sowed a little bit of doubt in people's minds about whether this was real or not. On top of that, you had drugs come into poor communities in inner cities and suburbs. Crack cocaine hit in the late 70s, early 80s. And the result of that was drug addiction, crime, urban decay, which spread outward from city centers into the suburbs. Suburban moms didn't want their kids to ride the bus anymore. They didn't want them hanging out at the playgrounds either. And they built bigger fences around their houses. So the kind of social connectedness that existed between neighbors in working class communities was breaking down. At the same time, you had employers moving away from the cities to the suburbs or overseas to lower cost countries. So you've got these twin forces coming together. You've got declining economic fortunes, particularly for African Americans. Many families were losing their homes and their cars. foreclosures became commonplace. Unemployment rates skyrocketed above
### Assistant: 20%
### Human: 20%, 30%. And yet somehow you couldn't blame the victim because everybody was saying, hey, pull yourself up by your bootstraps. America is the land of opportunity. Just work hard. Right? Except that if you grew up in that environment where there's nothing positive around you, how are you supposed to work hard? How are you supposed to study? How are you supposed to learn? How are you supposed to save money to buy a home or even keep a car running? Those are basic questions of practicality that most people understand intuitively unless they live under such circumstances.
### Assistant: Which again brings us to education. So let me ask a few questions about that. How do we address racism in America today in its various forms? So we talked about housing discrimination, redlining, but also institutionalized racism that exists throughout the entire system. How do we fight against that?
### Human: First off, I think we've gotta acknowledge that there's still a problem. Acknowledge that we haven't done enough as a nation to solve it. It's easy to forget that even now we've only had three presidents who aren't white. That's not a whole heck of a lot compared to the rest of the world. And every single member of the cabinet, including myself, has been white. Not a single one of us has been African American. Even though there are plenty of qualified African Americans to serve at the highest levels of government. That speaks volumes about how far we've fallen short over the years. But nonetheless, we've made some progress. As a consequence of civil rights legislation and court cases, the playing field has become somewhat leveler. The criminal justice system itself has undergone reforms in recent years. Police departments are beginning to engage in community policing rather than the military model of policing that we saw in the 60s and 70s. We've begun to desegregate our sports teams and entertainment industries. So we've taken steps forward. Unfortunately, we've also taken steps backwards. Since the election of the first African American president, hate crimes have spiked significantly in America. There's more racial animus now than there's been in decades. And unfortunately, Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric helped fan the flames of division.
So we've gone from a
