### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did you want to be president?
### Human: I think it was because I believed that if somebody like me could become president, then maybe other folks who were different than me might believe that they had a shot too. And even though I knew there were going to be plenty of people out there who would be saying, “Oh, you're not qualified,” and “You don’t look presidential enough,” and all these things, if someone like me can do it, maybe others would see themselves as having a chance too. So I didn't enter into this thinking about myself primarily as a public servant at the outset. I entered into it wanting to make sure that young people got some opportunity and wanted to help them understand what government could do to make their lives better. But over time, especially once I started running for office, I realized that it wasn't just about making sure that I had some impact; it was also about believing that other people could have an impact too.
### Assistant: Did your wife Michelle play any role in why you ran and whether you won the election?
### Human: Absolutely, she played a huge role. We met when we both worked on the same law firm's Chicago office. She was a corporate lawyer. I was working as a civil rights lawyer. And she was brilliant, obviously. And before long, I fell head over heels in love with her. And then she got pregnant, which meant that our life together changed dramatically. And yet despite that, we still stayed very close friends through thick and thin until we finally ended up getting married after years of dating. And during those years, she was always incredibly supportive. In fact, she was more supportive than I probably deserved. There were times when I was doing some dumb stuff, but she stuck with me anyway. And so it really was important to me to try to give her some credit because she deserves it. Because without her support, none of this would have happened.
### Assistant: What does she mean to you today?
### Human: Well, she means everything to me. As I said, we've known each other since we were teenagers. We grew up on the South Side of Chicago. Our families weren’t rich. My father was a pump attendant and a used car salesman, Michelle’s father was a city employee. Her mother stayed home. They never went to college. But somehow we found ourselves here. And we've built a life together, and she's my best friend and closest confidante. So she's just amazing, and I couldn't imagine my life without her.
### Assistant: How much of your life is defined by the events of your eight years in office? If I ask you to take away the memories of your presidency and you only remember one thing, what would it be?
### Human: Oh boy. That’s a tough one. It’s easy to say something about how proud I am of the work that we did to get healthcare done. I think that that was a seminal piece of legislation. It was hard to pass. We didn’t have total Democratic control of Washington at the beginning. We had divided government. And we managed to come together with some folks who disagreed with us politically to get something passed that millions of Americans rely on every day. I think that's pretty good.
I think we also showed ourselves to be able to deal with difficult international challenges in Syria and elsewhere around the world. The Iran nuclear agreement was another example where, even though it took a while for everybody to appreciate its value, ultimately it was a success. And we helped bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians, although we know we have a ways to go. I’m proud of that. I’m proud of what we accomplished in the area of criminal justice reform. I think we showed real leadership internationally, particularly in Asia and Africa, around Ebola and climate change.
So those are some areas where I feel like we left the country stronger than when we came in. And there were a lot of disappointments along the way. I wish we had been able to do more to improve the economy for ordinary middle class folks. We saw a recovery from the worst recession in generations, but it didn’t last as long as many people hoped it would.
### Assistant: You mentioned working across party lines. Do you think the current Congress will allow bipartisan progress to happen?
### Human: Not as much as they should. I think that unfortunately partisanship has gotten worse since I left. But I also think that’s partly because there aren’t as many moderates in either party anymore. For instance, back when I first ran for political office, I was probably considered kind of a moderate Democrat. Today if I tried to run for office now, I wouldn’t be able to call myself anything but a liberal. On the Republican side, it’s even harder. Back when I first started running, there were some Republicans who would describe themselves as moderates. Nowadays, it’s basically impossible to find a self-described moderate Republican in the House or Senate. So that makes it harder to build relationships across the aisle because nobody wants to be called a RINO (Republican In Name Only).
And so as a result, instead of trying to figure out how we can move forward, sometimes you end up just reacting to whatever the latest controversy happens to be rather than sitting down and actually problem solving. And hopefully we can change that dynamic in the future because I think that’s what America needs right now.
