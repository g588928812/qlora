### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are we even having this conversation? You're the most powerful person in the world, arguably the most powerful human being ever, and yet it feels like none of that matters anymore. We seem to be moving into a different phase where the people have more power than the politicians. Do you think that's true? Is there something about the nature of democracy that makes the political class irrelevant?
### Human: I guess what I would say is that, you know, democracy depends on informed citizens participating in public life. And if you don’t have an educated electorate, then you won’t get good government. So what I worry about is not just the role of elites, but also how well informed voters are. It turns out that, you know, one of the things that I was concerned about during the campaign is that I had to spend so much time talking about facts and getting across information because I felt like some of the public discourse was really distorted. There were a lot of folks out there who didn't understand what the issues were. Now, obviously, there were other factors involved, including the fact that I was running against somebody who was already famous, somebody who was very comfortable in front of audiences, somebody whose wife was already a celebrity before they entered the race. That meant that she brought a big media presence to the race and that helped him attract attention. But the truth is that our electoral process is geared towards mobilizing base voters. When you run for office, the way that campaigns work is you go after your base voter. Then you try to convince swing voters that you'll do okay. The problem is that sometimes those swing voters turn out to be less important than you might imagine. Because when you look at the last election, Donald Trump got elected despite losing the popular vote, despite winning fewer counties, despite losing congressional seats. He did it by winning a small
### Assistant: percentage of white men without college degrees.
### Human: Yeah, right! Right! So the point is that elections aren't just about the top tier of candidates. They're also about the millions of Americans who decide to stay home or cast ballots for third parties or write somebody else in instead. So the reason why it matters that we educate ourselves is precisely because we can still make a difference in terms of deciding which direction America goes. If we don’t take responsibility for educating ourselves about the issues, then we will simply continue to get bad governance.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask you another provocative question, which is that, while we are indeed responsible for educating ourselves, the system is designed such that we only do that once every four years. Or maybe it varies depending upon where you live.
### Human: No, no, you vote every single day. Everyday we vote by the way we act. What we buy, whom we support, where we shop, what we read. All of these choices affect the country. And so we need to be constantly engaged and aware of what's happening.
### Assistant: And you said “engaged,” meaning actually participate in the democratic process by voting.
### Human: Participate by voting, participate by paying attention, participate by educating yourself about the issues, participating in civil society organizations.
### Assistant: Okay, that's all great advice. I mean, it sounds pretty good, but how does any of that matter if you're going to lose anyway? How does any of that matter if the outcome is preordained? Isn't it just a waste of energy?
### Human: Well, I would say that it matters a lot whether you win or lose because it tells us something about where we stand. I mean, clearly, we've had periods in our history when we thought we were doing better than others, whether it was post World War II or the Reagan era. Those were times when we believed that we were making progress economically and socially. And it wasn’t until later that we realized that we weren’t keeping pace with the rest of the developed world.
So I think it's useful to periodically evaluate ourselves and see where we stand and see whether we're moving forward or backwards. Sometimes it helps to have somebody in power who understands that the world around them isn't static, that the economy is changing, that demographics are shifting, that technology is altering everything. Somebody who understands that and wants to adapt accordingly can help guide policy in ways that make sense.
