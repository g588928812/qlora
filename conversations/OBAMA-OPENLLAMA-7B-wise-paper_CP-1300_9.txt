### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected president?
### Human: Well, I think that we live in an era where it’s really hard to get people to agree on basic facts, much less make good decisions about their lives or their government based on those facts. And when you have a candidate like Donald Trump who doesn't just challenge conventional wisdom but often simply makes stuff up, then there are enough people out there who either don't believe what they see every single day or maybe don't even bother to look at what's going on around them. They take Mr. Trump literally but not necessarily seriously; they listen to him and they say, hey, this guy actually says something that sounds right to me because he speaks directly to what I'm feeling, which is that my life isn't working the way that I thought it would work and someone needs to stand up for us against all these people who are screwing me over.
### Assistant: So he spoke to a real pain felt by many Americans.
### Human: That was one part of it. But I also think that there were some folks who didn't feel any particular pain, but they still liked the idea of a disruptor. It wasn't so much that they had a specific agenda. I mean, they might have said that they wanted lower taxes, they wanted more jobs, they wanted a stronger military. But what they liked about Mr. Trump is that he seemed to be willing to shake things up. He seemed to be saying, “I am different.” And if your whole view of the world is that everything sucks except for me, then that can be pretty appealing.
### Assistant: Do you think there's something fundamentally wrong with our political system that allowed someone like Donald Trump to win?
### Human: No, no, nothing fundamental. I mean, look, the reason why somebody like Donald Trump could win is because our political system is broken. You know, we haven't updated the rules since before women had the vote, before people of color had the vote. We haven't updated the rules since before television existed. and before social media and cable news. And so, when you have an environment where everybody's got their own set of facts and nobody believes the same thing anymore, then it's very easy to persuade yourself that somehow you alone can fix things because you alone are telling the truth. When people have a choice between someone who may be untruthful and yet they think is getting things done versus someone else who's trying to stop them from getting their way, they may decide that, well, I want the guy who seems to be making progress despite the fact that he's fibbing to me, even though it may be hurting me in the long run.
Now, whether that dynamic is unique to today's America, I don't know. I suspect that it probably played itself out differently in other countries. But here in America, we have this combination of polarization, where both sides have become so dug into their respective positions that it feels impossible to break through the gridlock. At the same time, the economic anxiety that people feel is genuine and real and understandable. I mean, I understand how somebody who hasn't gotten a
### Assistant: raise in 30 years, somebody whose house values keep plummeting, somebody who's having trouble paying bills, somebody whose job is at risk due to automation, somebody whose kids are graduating college without finding a job. Yeah. All these people feel this sense of hopelessness. And yes, there's a lot of hate and anger and frustration.
### Human: Anger and fear. There's a lot of fear. There's a lot of anger. And again, none of that's new. What is new is the combination of the technology and the economics and the globalization that means that we have fewer decent paying manufacturing jobs, that a lot of people aren't getting the skills necessary to compete in a modern economy, and that while we may be doing better than most countries, we certainly are not doing great relative to how we did back in the ‘50s and ‘60s.
So yeah, I understand why people are angry. I understand why people are frustrated. I understand why people may turn toward a demagogue. But the antidote to that is not to pretend that somehow we should go back to the way things used to be or that somebody else is responsible for our problems. The antidote to that is to say, “Look, we need to update the rules of the road so that we can get past all of this fighting and bickering.” And unfortunately, we have a Congress that seems incapable of coming together on either a short-term or long-term basis to deal with issues like infrastructure or health care. Frankly, dealing with a pandemic ought to be something where Republicans and Democrats could come together and save tens of thousands of lives.
### Assistant: So what do you think is the role of the press in this election, and what do you think is the role of social media in this election?
### Human: I think that the role of the press is to tell the truth. I think that the role of the press is to provide context and perspective and try to help people figure out what's happening instead of just bombarding us with a constant stream of half-baked information and opinions masquerading as news. And unfortunately, during the campaign, too often the press was too focused on covering the horse race rather than trying to analyze what each side was offering and whether or not those solutions actually made sense. Now, I think that once people started looking closer at what the Trump administration was proposing in terms of its actual policy proposals and realizing that they weren't serious, that they basically contradicted themselves within the span of a few hours, once people started seeing that reality, that's when the numbers turned.
