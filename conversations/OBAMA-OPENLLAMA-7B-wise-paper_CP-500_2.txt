### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are we in such a bad place? We're having this discussion during a time where there seems to be more division than ever before. Where do you see the root cause of that divide? Is it just our society has changed since the 60s or something else?
### Human: Well, I think what's happening right now is a symptom of a deeper problem that goes back decades. And one thing that we have to understand about how democracies work is that when we talk about majority rule, it doesn't mean that the people with the biggest megaphones get to set the agenda. It means that they get their say at the ballot box. So what happens when you have a country like ours, which was founded on principles of democracy, but also had slavery and Jim Crow embedded into its DNA? You end up getting these two very different sets of ideas. One says, let's move forward together and try to figure out ways to bring everybody along; the other says, we've got to protect our interests above all else. Those are the two competing visions. The vision that prevailed over the past several decades was not necessarily the most inclusive or the most representative version of democracy. But it won elections because it resonated with enough voters to make sure it kept winning those elections. That started changing in the last couple of years. When Donald Trump ran for president in 2015/2016, a lot of people were surprised to see him win. But what he tapped into was a legitimate frustration that existed in many parts of the country that our government hadn't worked for them. There was no sense that Washington felt like it had their backs. They weren’t seeing results from all the investment that they'd
### Assistant: Made into the system.
### Human: Made into the system. And so, when you combine that with the fact that there's no shortage of racists and xenophobes in America, that combination was potent enough to give Trump the White House. And when you look at some of the things that he did while he was in office, whether it was separating children from their families at the border, whether it was trying to overturn the results of the election after he lost, whether it was encouraging white supremacist groups to mobilize, you can see why some people might feel frustrated or angry about their circumstances. However, the challenge for Democrats is that the way we're going to succeed politically is by uniting Americans around a common goal, not by dividing them up into separate camps based on race or religion or gender. In order to win elections, you need a coalition of people who may disagree with each other on issues like abortion rights or gay marriage or immigration policy or foreign policy, but agree that we should treat each other with dignity and respect regardless of whether we share those views. If you want to be successful electorally, then you have to find a way to speak to both sides without demonizing either side. And I think we've seen in recent months and years that Republicans seem to be much better at doing that than Democrats are. For example, if you look at how the GOP responded to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision earlier this year, they didn't attack women who supported Roe v
### Assistant: Wade. Wade. Yeah. Or even the ones that don't support Wade.
### Human: Even the ones that don't support Wade. They didn't go after them personally. Instead, they said, look, this is a legal issue that affects everyone. Whether you believe abortion is right or wrong, the point is that it shouldn't be decided by politicians. That's a principle that we can all agree on. Similarly, if you look at how Republicans handled January 6th, they didn't spend weeks arguing about whether it happened or how serious it was. They simply pointed out that Joe Biden won the election fairly and squarely, and asked everyone to accept that result. That was a position that virtually every Republican took. Meanwhile, Democrats spent weeks arguing amongst themselves about whether or not it was appropriate to call what happened at the Capitol “insurrection.” That was a debate that only served to inflame passions further rather than heal divisions. And the reason why I mention this is that, unfortunately, Democrats tend to be much better at pointing fingers at each other than they are at reaching across the aisle. As a party, we haven't always done ourselves any favors in terms of how we approach public discourse. And that needs to change if we want to be successful electorally moving forward.
### Assistant: Do you think we could take a step toward solving some of the problems you described by having less polarization within the Democratic Party? By having less infighting among Democrats?
### Human: Absolutely. I think it would help us tremendously. Because when we’re fighting amongst ourselves instead of focusing on how we can bring others along with us, we end up losing elections. Look at the last presidential campaign. If Hillary Clinton had spent more time talking about what she wanted to accomplish as president rather than spending her time defending herself against Bernie Sanders’ attacks, she probably wouldn't have lost the nomination to him. If she had then gone on to beat Donald Trump in the general election, we wouldn't be dealing with the mess we're in today. Unfortunately, too often, we see elected officials spending their time attacking each other rather than working together towards a common goal. And that's exactly what happened with Democrats in Congress earlier this month when Nancy Pelosi tried to pass her Build Back Better legislation through the House. Instead of coming together behind it despite disagreements, Democrats split down partisan lines, which allowed Republicans to block it from advancing. And that meant that millions of Americans who could benefit from the provisions included in that bill went without access to affordable childcare or health care or education or paid family leave. Again, it wasn't because anyone didn't want those things to happen. It was simply a failure to compromise effectively and reach agreement with Republicans.
I know that sounds like a pretty abstract concept, but I promise you that it makes a big difference in how well your message gets received. Think about it this way – if someone asks you to buy
### Assistant: Pizza, let’s say. What does it matter whether they ask nicely or rudely? The answer is pizza. No matter what tone they use, you’ll still buy pizza.
### Human: Right! Exactly! So it's important that we learn how to listen to each other and to speak in a way that shows respect for people even when we strongly disagree with them. After all, we live in a democracy. We don't have kings or dictators ruling over us. Our leaders are supposed to represent us, not tell us how we ought to behave. So we owe it to ourselves and to future generations to put aside petty differences and work together for the good of the country.
But ultimately, it's up to us, the citizens, to demand that our leaders do their jobs. Too often, we complain about what's happening in Washington without actually holding those responsible accountable. We need to stop looking for scapegoats and start taking ownership of our own actions. Only then will we be able to effect real change and create a brighter future for ourselves and our children.
