### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why should Americans trust Donald Trump? I know there's many reasons that have been discussed already today and yesterday and the day before that. But if we could just put aside those other issues, why should we still believe that Donald J. Trump is a trustworthy person?
### Human: Well, let me say this about your question. In general, when you ask a politician “Why do I deserve your vote?” The correct answer is, “Because you earned it.” And what does that mean? It means that you’ve demonstrated competence and character through your performance in office, not simply your rhetoric, which is how Mr. Trump seems to want people to make their judgments. And so, I think that if you were to look at any president’s record during his time in office, and then evaluate whether they deserve another four years in office, that would be the way you would go about it.
Now, having said all that, I will tell you that I am very concerned about the trajectory that this administration is taking us on. Now, again, I want to emphasize that I don't share some of these concerns because I feel threatened personally by what Donald Trump might do. What I am worried about is the precedent that he sets for future presidents. He doesn't seem to respect our institutions. We saw that in Helsinki. When asked about whether he believes Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies, he refused to take a position one way or the other, instead deferring to the Russian president. That is something that no previous president has ever done. So, it sends a signal about how seriously he takes the rule of law.
He also undermines the independence of the Justice Department and its attorneys. Again, that is unprecedented. Even Richard Nixon didn
### Assistant: Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. Sorry to interrupt. So you're saying, let me give you examples. One is Helsinki, yes. Two is undermining DOJ independence.
### Human: Those are two examples, but there are others. There was his firing of Sally Yates after she warned him that Mike Flynn had lied about his contacts with Russia. Then he fired James Comey after he refused to stop investigating Michael Flynn. And now, you mentioned Jeff Sessions earlier. Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. So it appears to me that this is a pattern of behavior where he feels free to disregard norms and laws when it suits him.
### Assistant: Now, you mentioned Helsinki. Can I pause on that? I mean, you raised some important points about Helsinki, and that was certainly one of them. But the fact remains that, despite what we may think of Donald Trump, he did get the support of 38% of voters in the last election. So even though I agree that this administration is going in a troubling direction, it's not clear to me that the majority of Americans want somebody else as president.
### Human: Look, I understand that sentiment. A lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they thought he offered solutions to problems like trade deficits and immigration. They felt that he was more likely than Hillary Clinton to bring back jobs to America. But I think that they underestimated how polarizing he would become. As a candidate, he promised to be a uniter, but as president, he's shown himself to be anything but that. And so I think that his approval ratings reflect that reality.
### Assistant: You talked about precedent. I guess my concern is that he creates a precedent where you can fire whoever you want, and it doesn't matter who it is.
### Human: Absolutely. And that is a dangerous precedent to set. But I also want to remind everyone listening that when Barack Obama came into office, the unemployment rate was around ten percent. Today, the unemployment rate is around 4%. The stock market is soaring. GDP growth is strong. Consumer confidence is high. And yet, somehow, we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump deserves a second term?
### Assistant: Do you see parallels between the election of Barack Hussein Obama and the election of Donald John Trump?
### Human: Oh yeah! Absolutely. Both were candidates who ran outside the establishment. Both appealed to disaffected voters who felt ignored by Washington politicians. And both won in landslides.
