### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are you optimistic about America? You've spoken about this many times. What does it mean to be optimistic about America at this moment in time?
### Human: I think we're in a unique period in American history where we can make progress on some very difficult issues without losing our way. And that's partly because we have reached a level of prosperity where there are no more excuses for us not to try to solve problems. And so if you look back over the last several decades, what we used to do is whenever we had a problem like crime or drugs or poverty or pollution or whatever, was we would throw money at it and hope that we could fix it. But during those same periods of time, the income inequality grew worse and worse and worse until now we have a situation where people are feeling left behind and they’re wondering why is their standard of living going down while everybody else seems to be doing okay. So when you combine the fact that we have a lot of money to spend but nobody feels better off than before, then you get a sense that we should be able to come together around solutions. Now, we may disagree about how we ought to achieve them, whether through taxation or regulation or incentives. But the point is that we ought to be able to find ways of moving forward and solving these problems, even though we don't always agree on the means. The other thing that makes me optimistic is that I see younger Americans who are willing to take risks, who are willing to work hard, who aren't just focused on immediate gratification. They want to figure out how do they become somebody who contributes to society
### Assistant: And that's the generation you grew up in and the generation your daughters are growing up in.
### Human: Yeah, that's right. I think one of the reasons that we have so much trouble getting things done is that older generations tend to be pretty risk adverse. We worry about losing what we already have. Younger folks, however, are willing to bet on themselves, bet on their ability to succeed, and are willing to take risks. So I think it'll be easier to deal with some of the challenges that we face now than it will be to deal with the ones that await us later, because there's less entrenched opposition, less resistance, less inertia. And so I am optimistic, not just because we’re wealthier than we were, although that helps, but also because we have fewer obstacles to overcome and therefore we can move faster.
### Assistant: That's hopeful. Do you see any signs of divisiveness in America today? How did you see that manifesting itself? Because it seemed to be getting worse and worse and worse every single year that you were president, especially after the election of Donald Trump.
### Human: Well, I think we have a divided country because part of the reason that we’re prosperous is because we’re divided into different parts. When you divide yourself into smaller pieces, each individual gets a bigger slice of the pie. If everyone got the same piece of pie, you wouldn't need to have competition, because everyone would be satisfied with what they got. So we have this tension between wanting to preserve the benefits that we've gained from dividing ourselves up and having competition, which creates pressure for improvements, versus wanting to bring us together. And I think what we saw in the last few years was a real push towards division. There was a sense of “us” against “them.” It wasn’t just Republicans versus Democrats; it was the establishment versus the insurgents. And that kind of thinking is antithetical to what makes America strong. If we only look out for our own interests, then we won’t end up having shared values, shared goals, shared aspirations.
### Assistant: Can you elaborate on that a little bit? I guess you touched upon it a little bit, but why is it antithetical to what makes America strong?
### Human: In order to be successful, you need to cooperate with others. You need to recognize that there are commonalities among us all, even if there are differences within us. You can't go around saying, “I care about my group,” and expect that you’re going to convince other groups that you care about them too. If you say that you love your race and hate the other races, you’re not going to persuade anybody else that you love the whole world. So I think what happened in recent years is that the temptation was to say, “We’re America First,” instead of looking out for America.
### Assistant: Is that a consequence of social media? Of the internet, the rapid spread of information, misinformation, disinformation? Or is it something deeper?
### Human: It’s probably both. Social media allows us to amplify our voices, and it allows us to engage in debates without necessarily having to sit across from each other. That said, I think that even if you took away social media, the basic problem is still there because people feel threatened by the changing demographics. They feel threatened by immigration. They feel threatened by technological disruption. They feel threatened by globalization. They feel threatened by shifts in political power. And so they’re reacting by trying to protect their position. Instead of looking ahead and saying, “How do we build on what we’ve achieved?” They’re looking backwards and saying, “What can we hold onto?” And that leads to greater divisions.
