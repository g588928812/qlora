### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we love presidents so much? Like, what does it mean that we've elected presidents for hundreds of years now? What does that tell us about our culture and our society?
### Human: Well, I think the reason why we're fascinated by presidents, even though they don't have a lot of power in terms of their executive authority, because when they speak, there's this expectation that they will be delivering some message or telling people how to live their lives. And so therefore we pay attention to them. We get interested in them. We become invested in whether or not they are successful. And then of course we want to know how they became successful. There's a fascination with them that goes beyond their policy accomplishments. It extends to how did they become president? What were the circumstances under which they came into office? How was it that they overcame adversity? Were they able to succeed despite obstacles placed in their path? Those kinds of questions intrigue us. But also, if you look at the way we celebrate presidents, Presidents Day is a holiday that celebrates George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, but also Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt and John F Kennedy. So there's something about these figures that appeals to Americans. And I think part of it is just sort of the nature of American history itself. America is always looking forward. Our founding fathers believed in progress. They believed that they could overcome obstacles and problems. That’s what led to our founding documents. It’s what led to the Constitution. It’s what led to the Declaration of Independence. The idea that America could move forward and become stronger and better was very appealing. So I
### Assistant: Think about it, like the Declaration of Independence, “We hold these truths to be self evident.” It’s bold words. It’s optimistic.
### Human: Absolutely, absolutely. You know, one thing I remember learning when I went back to college and studied American History was how important it was for America to create its own mythology. The Founding Fathers didn't believe that Britain had a good enough story. They needed to come up with their own myths. That's what led to the founding documents and that's what led to the creation of a nation based on the belief that we could overcome obstacles, that we could become stronger and better. And I think that remains true today. That’s part of why presidential elections, especially presidential elections, are so exciting. Because it tells us where America is going. It tells us where our country is headed. And it tells us who among the candidates can best lead us. Who among the candidates can inspire us? Who among the candidates can make us feel hopeful about the future?
I think we're in a moment right now where we need leaders who can give us hope about the future. Leaders who can inspire us to believe that we can overcome challenges. Leaders who can give us confidence that we can solve the big problems we face. Leaders who can remind us that America is still the greatest country in the world. Leaders who can remind us that America should continue to set examples for other countries around the world. Leaders who can remind us that America stands for freedom and democracy and human rights. Leaders who can remind us that America stands for equality and justice and fairness.
### Assistant: Do you think the presidency matters anymore? Like, do presidents matter? Is there any difference between Bill Clinton and George Bush versus Donald Trump and Barack Obama?
### Human: Oh, no, I definitely think presidents matter. Look, presidents have enormous influence over the direction of our country. And sometimes that influence is positive, and sometimes it’s negative. And it depends upon the individual president. But I think it’s safe to say that presidents are powerful individuals. When Barack Obama became president, many people wondered whether he would be able to accomplish anything. Some people argued that he couldn't accomplish anything because Republicans controlled Congress. Others argued that he wouldn't accomplish anything because Democrats controlled Congress. But what I saw during my time in office was that presidents do matter. And I think that's because presidents serve as role models. Presidents represent the values and ideals that most Americans share. They stand for things that unite us rather than divide us. And so when a president is effective, that helps bring people together and help promote unity within our country. And when a president is ineffective, that divides us. And so I think that presidents have tremendous power to influence the direction of our country.
### Assistant: Do you miss the White House?
### Human: No, I don't miss the White House. Actually, I never really liked the White House. To me, it was always just kind of a house. A residence. It wasn't a palace. I was surprised at how small it was. It seemed like such a tiny little house. But I guess that's fitting given that most presidents spend very little time actually living inside the White House while they're in office. Most presidents end up spending most of their time either traveling across the country or traveling abroad, or meeting with foreign heads of state or members of congress. Or maybe they’ll visit local schools and community centers. So most presidents don't spend a lot of time in the White House. I spent less time there than most presidents because I wanted to travel. And I knew that if I traveled more frequently, then I’d be seen more often outside the White House. People might recognize me more easily. They may hear my speeches. And therefore, that would have helped me build support for whatever legislation I proposed. But I decided instead to try to travel less frequently, so that I could meet with more ordinary Americans and show them that I cared about them. That I cared about their concerns. That I cared about their hopes. That I cared about their dreams. And that I thought about those dreams and hopes and aspirations every single day.
So I spent far less time in the White House than most presidents. In fact, the only times I
### Assistant: Spent more time in the White House than usual were probably on nights when I hosted parties for Michelle Obama.
### Human: Yes! (laughing) You were having fun!
