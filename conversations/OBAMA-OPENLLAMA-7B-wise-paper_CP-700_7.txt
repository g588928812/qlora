### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are we so divided today? Is it because our political discourse has become more partisan? Or is there something else at play that we're not talking about?
### Human: I think there's something deeper going on. And I do worry about what happens if we don't pay attention to it. You know, when I was running for president eight years ago, one of the things I said was, “This country faces big problems. We need to solve them.” And then I went out to Iowa and New Hampshire, and people asked questions like, “How many houses do you have?” And this wasn’t meant in any sort of ironic way. They just wanted to get inside your head. They wanted to figure out whether you were one of us or one of those elites who were disconnected. And they were suspicious.
### Assistant: So how did we get here? What changed? What happened between the beginning of your presidency and now?
### Human: I mean, there's no doubt that Donald Trump's election represented a wake up call, right? He tapped into some real frustrations. But I also think that during my administration, Republicans lost their grip on reality in ways that didn't help matters. When I came into office, they controlled both chambers of Congress, they had the White House, they had majorities in state legislatures around the country. And yet they couldn't deliver on a whole bunch of basic stuff that they promised voters. Instead, what they were doing was just trying to stop everything that I tried to accomplish, even though most Americans supported these policies. That created a lot of resentment among Democrats towards Republicans, but it also made the Republican base feel like Washington doesn't care about them anymore. Meanwhile, the economic recovery was uneven; millions of families still struggled economically after the Great Recession. Inequality was rising rapidly; income and wealth gaps were growing wider than they'd ever been before. The middle class was feeling under siege. All these trends were happening while technology and globalization were creating new winners and losers.
So all these factors combined to make America less united than it had been in decades. And that's why, even though I won two resounding victories, getting 3 million votes more than Mitt Romney in 2012 and winning reelection four years later, the margin of victory in both elections was smaller than John Kerry’s in
### Assistant: 2004.
### Human: Yeah. So even though it looked like the country was moving back toward normalcy, it actually felt like there was a deepening divide between red and blue America.
### Assistant: What do you attribute that to? It seems like there should be more agreement than disagreement.
### Human: There is more agreement than disagreement. Most Americans agree with each other on pretty much every issue. They believe that we ought to raise taxes on the wealthy and cut them for everybody else. They want to strengthen Social Security. They support paid family leave. They want clean air and safe drinking water. They want high-quality public schools and affordable higher education. They want universal access to health insurance coverage. So where the disagreements come from is usually over tactics. How aggressive should we be in combating climate change? Should we raise the minimum wage? How far do we go on immigration reform? Do we expand voting rights or limit them? These are all legitimate debates to have, but unfortunately, too often what we hear instead is “you're either with us or against us,” and “if you side with the enemy, you must be evil.”
And what ends up happening is that it becomes harder for politicians to govern, because nobody feels like they can work across the aisle anymore. And meanwhile, you end up with a situation where people feel like they have to choose sides, which makes it easier for demagogues to rise up and tell people exactly what they want to hear rather than the truth.
Now, it doesn't mean there aren't plenty of folks out there who are willing to listen to the truth. I always say I learned more from my critics than my friends sometimes. But it does make it hard to govern when you live in a world where it
### Assistant: feels impossible to find common ground with anyone, especially when they've chosen sides already.
### Human: Absolutely. Because once you've decided you're Team Red or Team Blue, it means you've got nothing left except to yell at the opposition and hope they fail.
