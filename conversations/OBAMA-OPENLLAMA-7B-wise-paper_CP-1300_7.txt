### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think Donald Trump was elected? What did people want that they were not getting?
### Human: I'm sure there are many different answers to this. And it wasn’t just one thing. I mean, if we assume that everybody who voted for Trump was racist, then obviously I would be wrong to ask why because I already know the answer. The better way to think about this is to say that there are certain kinds of Americans who feel like their world is changing too fast, right? That either through globalization or technology or immigration or some combination of all those things, that what they understand themselves to be is under threat. They don’t necessarily believe that any of these changes are bad per se, but they’re enough of a nuisance that it makes them wonder whether America is still going to be around when their kids grow up.
### Assistant: Are you saying that they were mostly white working class?
### Human: Well, yeah, certainly part of it was. But remember, the Rust Belt was also key parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin. There were plenty of college graduates who felt exactly the same way. In fact, the only difference between them and the non-college folks was that the college folks had slightly more education, so they could articulate their concerns better than the others.
### Assistant: So the question is, how can we respond to this feeling of loss of identity and the fear of losing your place in society? How can we address that?
### Human: Well, look, I think that there’s no single prescription. You have to try to meet people where they are. If somebody says, “I'm really worried about my job,” give them a skills training program so that they get retrained so that they can find another job. If somebody else says, “We need to make sure our schools are doing well” and they care about their kid’s education, then help them figure out how to get involved at the local level so that they can actually see progress being made and make decisions about what kind of school district they want and so forth. You have to meet people where they are, which means sometimes you might have to disappoint them along the way. But hopefully over time, they will realize that even though you didn’t quite get everything done exactly the way they wanted it, overall they've got a sense that they're moving forward. And that's ultimately what most people care about.
### Assistant: So let's talk about immigration. You said yourself, you wrote in the book, "We are now living in an age of mass migration unlike anything that America has seen since its own founding." Which is true. "And yet," you go on, "our political debate about immigration is stuck in a time warp." Where does it come from?
### Human: Yeah, so it comes from both sides. It comes from the Republican side because they've convinced their base that somehow immigrants are going to take their jobs and therefore they should be opposed to immigration. But it also comes from the Democratic side because they haven't bothered to explain why it makes sense economically and otherwise to keep on welcoming new people into our country. We’d probably be a poorer nation without immigrants, right? But if you tell somebody that every day, then they’re probably gonna tune you out.
### Assistant: Because they feel like someone's taking something away from them. They feel like somebody is coming in and using their stuff.
### Human: Exactly. And again, this isn’t unique to the United States. Europe went through similar debates about refugees coming from Syria during the height of the Syrian refugee crisis. People across the political spectrum said, “Well, maybe we shouldn't be letting these Syrians in.” And then suddenly when somebody is knocking on their door and telling them, hey, this person is a potential terrorist, they say, “Oh, maybe we shouldn't have let him in after all.” And it's exactly the same dynamic. You can't reason with that. All you can do is hope that you can convince people that ultimately they benefit from having more diversity in their communities and so forth.
