### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do you think there's so much hate in America today? And also, why is it that when people are at their worst, they seem to be most emboldened? It seems like we're living through some pretty dark times right now, but it doesn’t feel like we’ve ever been in such dark times before.
### Human: Well, I think this is a question whose answer gets more complicated the longer you look at it, because obviously human beings are complex creatures. But one factor that makes our current moment different than any other time in recent memory is simply the volume and the reach of information and misinformation that we all have access to. And while the internet and social media can connect us around the globe, it’s also created a space where we see not only just a constant stream of facts, but also where we can get exposed to perspectives and ideas that we never would have encountered before. Now, this obviously poses both opportunities and challenges. On the plus side, if you’re looking to learn about something new, you can find out about it quickly and easily, whether it’s how to fix your car or what’s happening in another country halfway across the world. At the same time, though, if you’re looking for something specific, there’s no guarantee that you’ll find the truth. So I think part of the challenge that we face in this moment is that the sheer amount of information available means that everybody is going to encounter things that don’t seem quite right. That might be true even if you’re trying to do your best and you’re doing everything you can to make sure you’re getting accurate information. Because remember, even when someone is telling you the truth, they may still present it in a way that isn’t necessarily helpful or doesn’t
### Assistant: No, absolutely. I totally agree with you. The good thing about the internet is it’s a great equalizer. Everyone can speak volumes without having credentials. You could literally say anything about anything and millions will listen. There’s no gatekeepers anymore except maybe yourself and your own integrity. That’s a beautiful thing. However, yeah, unfortunately, you’re right. Even though everyone should strive for the highest standards of truthfulness and accuracy and so on, it’s hard sometimes to discern between those competing agendas. Especially when those agendas are coming from people who are themselves are struggling with their own mental health issues or are perhaps outright lying.
### Human: Yeah, well said. And then, you know, once again, if somebody is willing to lie to you about something small enough, you know, how easy is it to imagine them willing to lie to you about something bigger? So this is the sort of dilemma that we’re facing.
### Assistant: Well, let me ask another question then. Do you believe that Donald Trump is responsible for the January 6 insurrection? He was certainly the main character leading up to that event.
### Human: Yeah, I mean, look, ultimately, every person decides for herself or himself whether to vote for someone based on the totality of their record and their conduct over many years, and you weigh all these various factors. Obviously, the events of January 6 loom very large in determining anybody’s view of President Trump’s fitness for office. After all, what happened on that day is a direct assault on the rule of law, on the Constitution itself, and on our system of government. And so anybody who feels strongly about those values has got to take that into account in making their decision.
### Assistant: Is it possible to separate the fact that he incited the attack from the simple fact that he did not stop the attack after it began? Like literally as the attack was ongoing, there were people inside the White House that wanted him to call off the National Guard. He didn’t call the National Guard until hours later. Is that something that we can ignore? Just because he didn’t say the magic words “go home,” does that somehow absolve him of responsibility for the actual physical attack that was underway?
### Human: Well, I think anybody watching that day would conclude that President Trump was a significant enabler of the insurrectionists who attacked the Capitol. And I mean that literally, meaning he provided oxygen to this false narrative that the election had been stolen, which is directly contrary to reality. He encouraged his supporters to come to Washington. He spent months falsely claiming that the vice president had the authority to overturn the results of the election. And when the violence started to break out at the Capitol, he watched it unfold on television for several hours, initially seemed to delight in it. And only belatedly did he tweet out a message calling for the rioters to go home. In the interim, he told people who were pleading with him to call upon the military to intervene to basically “stay calm” and not engage in illegal activities.”
### Assistant: What’s your reaction to the fact that there are Republicans who are still defending him, even though he lost the election, even though he incited the insurrection, even though it’s clear now that he’s unfit for the position of the presidency?
### Human: Well, look, I understand why they’d want to defend him. I mean, they clearly have a lot of financial interests at stake. They clearly have a lot of political calculations that they need to make. If they alienate President Trump’s base, that could cost them in future elections. So I understand why they’d want to stick with him. I don’t agree with that calculus because what they’re effectively saying is that they value party unity above the principles that they claim to care about. And that goes against the entire tradition of the Republican Party since its inception. We know that Abraham Lincoln was elected despite efforts of the previous Republican administration to deny him the Oval Office. Similarly, I think that many of the individuals currently serving in Congress who are trying to protect Trump realize that the only reason they’re able to stay in power is because of the progressives in their own caucus. So in essence, they’re protecting somebody who has consistently gone out of his way to undermine anyone else who might stand in his way.
