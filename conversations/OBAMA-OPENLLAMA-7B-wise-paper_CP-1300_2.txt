### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why are so many people who have done good things in this world unable to be elected president?
### Human: Well, it's interesting because I think there's no easy answer. You know, we all live in our own bubbles. There's a lot of confirmation bias going on where we just tune into news sources that tell us what we already believe. And then when somebody who doesn't look like us, talk like us, or share our values gets a national platform, somehow they must be doing something wrong. They must not really care about us. So the more that voters can step outside their comfort zone and hear someone new speak, whether they agree with them or not, but at least understand that these folks have real ideas and real plans, if they can break through some of those barriers, they might get elected.
### Assistant: Yeah, but that seems to work better at the local level than at the federal level. I mean, there’s still a sense in which the way you get power at the local level is you get known. You get to actually talk to people and see how your idea works out practically. It feels like at the federal level, there's too much money involved and too many special interests and too many things to pay attention to and so the only thing that matters is what is said during debates and what is seen on TV screens for a few seconds during the debates and the rest of it is all kind of, it's all just marketing and then aftermarketing.
### Human: That's probably true. But the sad truth is most people don't even watch those debates until they're over, right? Most Americans have their TiVo or their DVR set up so they can fast forward through the boring parts. I remember once we were running against John McCain in 2008 and I was giving this big speech about why my health care plan would make sense. And afterwards, one of the writers came up to me and she goes, “You know, that wasn't the best moment,” meaning her words, not mine. She says, “The best moment was when you answered questions.” Because nobody saw that part! [laughter] And frankly, unless you got the top three questions asked, nobody really cared.
### Assistant: If you could go back and talk to yourself when you were running for office, either eight years ago or four years ago, what would you say? What advice would you give yourself?
### Human: Oh boy. Probably, well, let me start off by saying that I wish that I had been a bit less guarded throughout the whole process. Early on, I think I was pretty raw and I didn't realize exactly how powerful images and moments are. For instance, early on in the campaign, before I knew anything about policy, I gave a speech in Berlin. I went to the Brandenburg Gate and talked about the importance of standing up to dictators and trying to inspire young Europeans to take control of their destiny. And everybody wrote about that speech as though I had won the election. The next day, Time magazine put me on the cover with the word hope emblazoned across the front of it. And suddenly everyone thought I was the guy. Had I realized that image meant so much and that there was such value in projecting confidence and inspiring other people, maybe I wouldn't have gotten so down on myself whenever I messed up. But instead of owning those mistakes and learning from them, I beat myself up pretty badly every time something didn't go quite right.
### Assistant: Do you feel like you missed opportunities? Where do you feel like you didn't show enough of your full self, that you showed only half of your full self?
### Human: Yes, absolutely. In fact, I would argue that the biggest missed opportunity was when I decided to run for president in 2008 rather than 2004. By waiting another cycle, I would have given myself more time to develop relationships with key members of Congress and learn about how the system worked. And also I would have had more time to build up an organization on the ground that could help support me and ultimately win the nomination and the general election.
That said, sometimes life presents you with opportunities that you can't pass up. And I certainly believed that America was in need of change and that my candidacy was a chance to move the country forward. Unfortunately, we didn't always follow through on everything I tried to accomplish while I was in office. One of the reasons I wanted to write this book is to hopefully help future generations avoid some of the same problems we faced.
For example, early on in my administration, I called together a meeting of my economic advisors and said, “Look, we've got this big problem with the economy. We've lost almost 5 million jobs since the beginning of the recession. Unemployment is hovering around 10%. How do we get out of this hole?” A lot of the traditional economists present said that since the Great Recession officially ended in June of 2009, job growth should be picking up. Instead, we kept losing jobs. Finally, I asked this
### Assistant: Economist, "What does 'great recession' mean?" Does it mean we had a recession before June 2009? No, it means we hit rock bottom. So technically speaking, it started in December 2007. Correct, okay.
### Human: And then I asked him, “Well, what does ‘end’ mean?” And he finally admitted that the technical definition of end is that you haven't fallen any further. And then I said, “So theoretically we could fall farther?” He said yes, theoretically we could fall farther. And I thought, well, if we keep falling, then obviously what we're experiencing isn't just a bad patch; it's a major depression. But unfortunately, too many of the people around me didn't want to face that reality. They told me that since we hadn't technically reached rock bottom yet, there was no reason to panic. And then they spent months telling me that unemployment would drop below 8% soon. And meanwhile, it continued to climb higher.
Until finally, one of my senior economic advisors, Larry Summers (ph), looked me straight in the eye and said, “Mr. President, you're delusional. The recovery is not happening.” And honestly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Here's this guy who'd been my chief economist for nearly twenty years. I'd known him longer than anyone else in my inner circle. I considered him a friend and a mentor. Yet now he was basically calling me stupid. Of course, that's not what he said. He couched it in terms of math. But deep down, I knew he thought I was del
