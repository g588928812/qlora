### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why do we need government?
### Human: We need government because otherwise there's no rule of law; otherwise it’s every man for himself. Government doesn't have all the answers. I mean, one of the things that people often misunderstand about government, particularly if they come out of a business background, is the fact that even though government is going to try to solve problems and it can sometimes get it wrong, ultimately what makes our society work is the rule of law and the idea that everybody else is subject to certain rules whether or not you like them. And without government, those rules are just whatever the strongest person in town says they are. Now, obviously when government starts doing stuff that really isn't working, then citizens will push back and they should push back. But at its core, government is necessary so we don't end up living in some Hobbesian state where “life is nasty, brutish, and short.”
### Assistant: What does it take to be a good leader? I think this is a question I'm also curious about as someone who was part of a community for quite a while before I started a podcast, which I think is more effective than leading a country. So community leaders are very interesting to me because it seems like leadership is needed everywhere.
### Human: Well, the definition of leadership is pretty simple, right? It means taking responsibility for something bigger than yourself. And that might sound banal, but it actually requires you to say, “I recognize that I have certain talents and abilities, and I've been given these gifts by God, by nature, however you want to put it, and they could either be used to help other people or to simply line my own pockets or to satisfy my own ego. And therefore, wherever there are responsibilities that others aren't fulfilling, wherever there is something that needs to be done, somebody needs to step forward and shoulder the burden and make sure that it gets done.”
### Assistant: And that involves both vision and action.
### Human: Exactly. You can talk big and you can inspire people through your words, but unless you actually put pen to paper or pick up a phone and call somebody and say, “Hey, let’s go do this,” nothing happens. And that requires you to sometimes risk your own reputation or your own standing among your peers. Sometimes it means disagreeing with people that you grew up with. That's always hard. Sometimes it means bucking the system even when you know that everyone around you thinks that you're nuts.
### Assistant: In order to lead effectively, you have to be able to see the world clearly enough to understand that you're the only one that can fix this particular problem. Is there any way you could describe how you got that insight into what your role is supposed to be in this world? Because there must have been moments throughout your life where you felt inadequate to the task.
### Human: Oh yeah, absolutely. There were plenty of times growing up where I didn't feel like I had much of anything to offer anybody. I was a skinny kid from Hawaii who didn't know a whole bunch about the real world until after college. And yet somehow along the way I found myself saying yes to the possibility of becoming president. And maybe it sounds Pollyannaish now, but nobody thought that I would become president when I was younger. Not even close. And the truth is that you don't usually achieve what you set out to do unless you’re willing to step outside of your comfort zone and do something that you wouldn’t normally do.
And so early on, I had to develop a capacity to look at the world through somebody else’s eyes and ask myself questions such as, “What does this person need?” rather than thinking about myself and trying to figure out what my agenda is. And once you start to do that, then suddenly you realize that you’ve got a perspective that nobody else has. And then it becomes incumbent upon you to share that perspective with others and hopefully convince them that their own lives would be better off because you care enough about them to try to improve theirs.
### Assistant: The “other” word that you use is powerful. I think “community” is another powerful word. It’s the “we” versus the “me”. Do you ever find yourself slipping into “me”? Or is there something about “us” that you think you naturally gravitate towards?
### Human: No, I think that “we” is far more compelling than “me”. And honestly, I think that’s true not just because I happen to believe that it’s morally superior to view ourselves as members of larger groups rather than individuals, although that certainly helps. But I think that “we” is the only hope for humanity because the reality is that we are all interdependent upon one another. And so if “me” wins, it’s not just “you” who loses; it’s “we”, too. Whereas if “we” win, then “your” situation may be improved, but mine probably won’t be that much worse than yours. If “we” lose, well, we’re all screwed.
