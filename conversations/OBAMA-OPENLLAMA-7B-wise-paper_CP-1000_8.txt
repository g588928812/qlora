### Assistant: This is my conversation with Barack Obama, an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Known for his eloquent oratory and progressive policies, he made history as the first African American to hold the presidency. During his two-term tenure, Obama championed healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act and led initiatives on climate change, notably signing the Paris Agreement. His presidency, characterized by a focus on inclusivity and diplomacy, has been influential in shaping contemporary American politics.

Mr. Obama, welcome and thank you for being here. Let me start by asking a provocative question: Why did America elect Donald Trump? What do we need to understand about this election that was so surprising to so many people?
### Human: Well, there are a couple of answers to your question. One answer is just simply because Hillary Clinton won more votes than Mr. Trump, but she didn't get enough Electoral College votes. And so what ended up happening was, well, we have something called the EC system where it’s not just how many people voted for each candidate; it’s actually what state they’re located in determines whether their vote matters. So if you live in California, which is a very populous state, then even though you might only be one person, your vote is weighted more heavily than somebody else living in Wyoming who may be one person out of every few thousand. Now, when you add that up across the country, the fact that Secretary Clinton got more popular votes than Mr. Trump meant that she would have won the Electoral College had she gotten all those votes in the right places. But instead, she lost some key states, namely Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida. And that’s why she lost the Electoral College while winning the popular vote. So that was one factor. Another factor is that Mr. Trump ran against the Washington establishment and he was able to tap into some deep seated frustrations among working class voters who felt like over the last several decades, wages have flatlined, there hasn’t been any real progress on creating new jobs. They feel like trade agreements have cost them work opportunities and their communities. There’s also a lot of racial anxiety around issues
### Assistant: I think he tapped into that really well. That's what I mean. It wasn't necessarily that he created this feeling, but he tapped into it.
### Human: Yeah. He tapped into it, but you can’t ignore the reality that these were folks who were hurting economically and they weren’t benefiting from trickle down economics. And so there was a lot of pent up anger and frustration and resentment and there was nobody offering them a way forward other than “I'm going to make America great again.” And at least for some people who were willing to give him a chance, that sounded appealing. It also helped that he was a celebrity. He was someone who had never held elected office before, but he was famous. So, you know, that’s another reason why he could get away with saying things that maybe someone else couldn’t get away with without losing their job.
Yeah, he certainly said some controversial things during the campaign that made a lot of us cringe, especially coming from an individual who was supposed to be a leader of our free world.
### Assistant: Well, let’s talk about that. Because there's this whole idea of decorum in politics. And I remember during the primaries hearing people say nice things about Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, John Kasich. The nicest thing anyone ever said about you was that you’re likable. I don’t know if you remember that.
Yes, that’s true. You know, honestly, I think that’s probably the biggest compliment anybody paid me because I always thought I was pretty decent guy. And so for people to say that is a high compliment, particularly since they were running against me.
### Human: Right. And then once you became president, I guess it was fair game. People started questioning whether you were qualified or whether you were honest or whether you were truthful.
### Assistant: Or whether you were Muslim. All that kind of stuff.
Well, yes. And it seems like that happened after the first year or two of your presidency.
You mentioned earlier that some of the most important decisions you had to make were economic policy related. So the two that stick out to me as we’ve already discussed the stimulus package and the auto bailout. Those were big decisions. Can you tell me what went through your mind when you decided to approve both of those?
### Human: Well, let me take the second part first, because the decision to save the auto industry turned out to be extremely critical. Here was a situation where General Motors and Chrysler were essentially teetering on bankruptcy. They needed help. Our goal ultimately was to make sure that they didn’t go under completely. If either GM or Chrysler had gone bankrupt, thousands of workers would have lost their jobs. The ripple effect throughout the economy would have been catastrophic. So it was important to try to figure out ways to keep these companies alive. We knew they would need help from the federal government because their revenues were falling sharply due to the recession. Their costs were continuing to rise due to things like health care benefits and pensions. They basically had no money left to pay their bills. And so the best option that we saw was to provide them with financial support in exchange for taking on additional worker obligations and making changes in terms of their business models so that they become healthier going forward. As you know better than most people, it’s hard to turn around failing businesses. And so we wanted to see if we could find a formula whereby we could allow these companies to stay open while they fixed themselves up so they wouldn’t have to come back to us years later needing help again.
### Assistant: Do you remember the moment when you realized this will be a long process? Like this is going to take a long time?
### Human: Yes, I do. Actually, I vividly remember that moment because we spent weeks talking to different stakeholders inside and outside the company and trying to figure out exactly what the options were. Ultimately, what we came to believe was that there were three possible scenarios. One was that the company should continue to operate normally. That would lead to a loss of market share for GM and Chrysler and ultimately would put the U.S. car industry at risk of extinction altogether. The second alternative was for us to step in and provide direct assistance to the companies. And we tried to structure that assistance in such a way that the taxpayers wouldn’t end up owning the companies. The third alternative was for the companies to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which means that they would essentially close shop and liquidate their assets. But we thought that would leave thousands of workers unemployed. There would be a huge ripple effect throughout the supply chain. It would send shockwaves through the broader economy. And so that was why we ultimately concluded that it was important for us to act quickly. Even though we weren’t certain precisely how the action would play out, we felt it was better to err on the side of helping rather than doing nothing and allowing these companies to fail.
